When it communicates, you hear everything it transmits and hear everything spoken to it. You can dictate its answers if you choose. You do not need line of effect or line of sight to the sitak to use this benefit.</span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/397" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 397</a>.</p>
