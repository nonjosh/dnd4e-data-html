They recognize, however, that violence is sometimes necessary to achieve greater harmony. Just as destructive winds can carry away anything that stands against them, a monk of the four winds is an overwhelming force.<br/><br/><h3>FOUR WINDS MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gusting Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack and the attack hits, you shift your speed after resolving the attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mystery of the Four Winds (11th level)</b>: After each extended rest, choose one of the following mysteries.
