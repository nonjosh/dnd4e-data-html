		<h1 class="player">Tome Adept</h1><p><i>&quot;I will unlock the mysteries kept within this tome—even those not yet bound within it.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard, tome implement mastery<br/><br/>As a wizard, you are aware that books are more than the sum of their parts. They are more than paper, binding, ink, and stitches. Hidden within are secrets, knowledge, and mysteries waiting to be unlocked. And as a caster focused on the secrets of words, formulas, and incantations, you are perfectly suited to unlocking the secrets hidden within them.<br/><br/><h3>TOME ADEPT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paper Secrets (11th level)</b>: Each time you gain a new level of daily wizard attack spells or wizard utility spells, you learn one extra spell of that level (in other words, add three spells to your spellbook instead of only two). This stacks with other feats and abilities that increase the number of spells in your spellbook.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secret Formularies (11th level)</b>: It costs you half as much as normal to copy rituals into your spellbook. You gain a +2 bonus to skill checks made as part of a ritual.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tome of Confusion (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each enemy you hit with an attack before the end of your turn is dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maze of Words (16th level)</b>: When you score a critical hit against an enemy, that enemy is dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Tome Adept Attack 11</span>Knowledge Blast</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You hold up your tome and concentrate all your knowledge through it into a beam of pure energy, firing it at your ignorant foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a tome</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d8 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and you push the target 2 squares.

While trapped, the target ceases to exist and can take no actions until it saves. It has line of sight and line of effect to no creature, and no creature has line of sight or line of effect to it. When the target saves, it reappears wherever it was when it was hit by this spell. If that square is occupied, it reappears in the nearest available square of the target’s choice.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/380" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 380</a>, page(s) 44.</p>
