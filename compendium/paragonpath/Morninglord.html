		<h1 class="player">Morninglord</h1><p><i>&quot;Where our god’s light shines, there is hope. Where there is no light, we quest.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any divine class, must worship Amaunator<br/><br/>In the years following the Spellplague, Lathander, the eternally young god of new beginnings and hope, transfigured into his ancient incarnation Amaunator. Although Amaunator dropped the youthful mask he had worn for centuries, his experiences as the Dawn Lord shook him from his ancient mindset. Amaunator is still a dignified god of immense age, but he remembers his youth, and he encourages his followers to do the same.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Morninglord, you are the champion of your god’s youth. The optimistic spirit of Lathander guides you as you seek to master the chaos of the new world. The fires of your god burn within you and lend you the inexhaustible energy of youth. You are tireless, fierce, rebellious and full of hope. You shine like a beacon in the darkest hours of night, inspiring those around you to greatness they never dreamed possible.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your enemies you are the searing sun itself, shedding scorching brilliance from your form. Evil is confronted by fiery annihilation in your wake, for though you walk with Lathander’s carefree spirit, your heart burns with the all-consuming fire of Amaunator.<br/><br/><h3>MORNINGLORD  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Militant Dawn (11th level)</b>: When you use any channel divinity power, you can also choose an enemy within 5 squares of you to take radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unflagging Energy (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action to make an attack, that attack is a critical hit on a roll of 18 or higher<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Burning Radiance (16th level)</b>: Whenever you hit with a power that has the radiant keyword, the target gains vulnerability 10 to radiant damage until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Morninglord Attack 11</span>Pure Glow</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With a whispered prayer, a warm, white radiance spreads from you in waves that burn your foes with holy energy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Targets</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d8 + Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier radiant damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, enemies that begin their turn in the burst take 10 radiant damage.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Morninglord Utility 12</span>Rising Sun</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Radiance emanating from you soothes the spirits and wounds of your allies, knitting rent flesh and granting them the strength they need to continue the fight.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Targets</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You and your allies regain hit points equal to 5 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: Bloodied allies within 5 squares regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Morninglord Attack 20</span>Lance of Dawn</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With eye-burning brilliance, a nimbus of radiant power streaks into your foe, filling your enemy with holy energy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d10 + Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier radiant damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Ongoing 5 radiant damage (save ends).
