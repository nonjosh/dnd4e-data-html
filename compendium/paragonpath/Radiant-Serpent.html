		<h1 class="player">Radiant Serpent</h1><p><i>&quot;The spirit of the couatl burns brightest.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>You raise your eyes and heart to the stars and to the spirit of the shining, winged serpents that helped tame the primordials. You have chosen the couatl as a spiritual ally, embracing that legendary creature’s power so thoroughly that you assume its very form. You emulate your shining ally by rising above the battle with a flourish of power or by passing through your enemies like a radiant spirit.<br/><br/>Like couatls, you understand the necessity of sacrifice. The coils of your power can trap enemies that would otherwise harm your allies, but you must be willing to take those allies’ hurts on yourself. If your own survival is jeopardized as you protect your friends, so be it.<br/><br/><h3>RADIANT SERPENT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Radiant Glow (11th level)</b>: You gain radiant resistance equal to one-half your level and a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects that immobilize or restrain you.
