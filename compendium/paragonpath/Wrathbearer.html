Wild and unpredictable, no lesson stuck with you. No matter how hard you tried, youâ€™d  revert back to your old reckless ways.

In either case, your time at the war college was brief when it was  clear the instructors had nothing to teach you. In your adventures since, you have learned to channel your wrath into your attacks. When you look back on the stodgy lessons and unbearable drills, you laugh because you have learned a better way to kill.<br/><br/><h3>WRATHBEARER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mounting Rage (11th level)</b>: When you miss with an invigorating attack power, you gain a +2 bonus to your next attack roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Savage Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and add 1[W] extra damage to damage rolls with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Endless Endurance (16th level)</b>: You increase your maximum hit points by twice your Constitution modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Wrathbearer Attack 11</span>Explosive Outburst</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your wrath reaches a boil and you explode with violence, ripping your weapon through your foes in one savage sweep.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Invigorating</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst you can see</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and if the target is marked by you, it falls prone.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Wrathbearer Utility 12</span>Mocking Target</h1><p class="flavor"><i>No attack against you is good enough to escape your scathing, infuriating tongue.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, when an enemy attacks you, it is marked until the end of your next turn, unless the attack reduces you to 0 hit points or fewer.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Wrathbearer Attack 20</span>Unequaled Might</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attack hits your enemies hard and they cannot find the strength to stand.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Invigorating</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst you can see</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target falls prone.
