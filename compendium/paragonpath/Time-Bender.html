		<h1 class="player">Time Bender</h1><p><i>&quot;When you talk about the passage of time, how little you really understand. For me, time and space are interchangeable.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psion<br/><br/>Psions, especially those who prefer telekinetic powers to telepathic ones, instinctively recognize how the fabric of space is just one side of the swath; the other side is time. Objects, creatures, and worlds travel through both, though time is a direction that has only a single route—forward—while space allows movement any which way.<br/><br/>Or so it seems to most. But for those who are able to literally grasp the fabric of space to stretch, compact, and shape it, time is more malleable, within limits. Understanding this fact opens up new possibilities.<br/><br/>You recognize time’s pliability. You already have an arsenal of mental tools capable of gripping the seams in the material of space. You have discovered that you can also use your understanding of the nature of time as a springboard to greater power. As your knowledge of time’s intricacies has grown, so has your ability to affect time. You believe you’ll soon be wielding time like a sword to cut down your foes before they even understand they’re in danger.<br/><br/><h3>TIME BENDER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Loan from the Past (11th level)</b>: Whenever you roll initiative, roll an additional d20. Once during that encounter, you can replace an attack roll, a skill check, an ability check, or a saving throw with that roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Time-Lapse (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack with a psionic power, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll and can teleport 6 squares as a free action after the attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Borrow from the Future (16th level)</b>: You can take an extra move action during your turn, but if you do so, you lose your move action on your next turn. You can’t use this feature on consecutive rounds.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Time Bender Attack 11</span>Bonds of Time</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You grasp threads of time and pull them, causing your foes to lose track of the present.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Augmentable</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 1 within 20 squares</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d6 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and the target can take only one action during its next turn.</p><b>Augment 2</b><br/><p class="powerstat"><b>Hit</b>: 3d6 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Time Bender Utility 12</span>Time Strider</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You slow down time slightly, moving like a hummingbird as you dart among your slow-moving friends and foes.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and all defenses, and you gain a power bonus to speed equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Time Bender Attack 20</span>Lost in Time</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You detach your foe from the swath of space-time it currently inhabits.
