		<h1 class="player">Ghost of Eventide</h1><p><i>&quot;Netheril means to enslave us. I have something to say about that. I think I’ll let my blade do the talking.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue from Cormyr, the Dalelands, Elturgard, Evereska, Gray Vale, Luruar, or Sembia<br/><br/>You thrive in the time between sundown and night. The shadows of twilight are all that keep you alive. They are a shroud even the Shadovar cannot pierce, from which you strike at their foul hearts. And long before the Netherese can find you, you’ve returned to the twilight shroud.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a silent blade in the mists, a trained killer whose skill at stealth foils even those foes who live in shadow and illusion. You are a ghost of eventide, a vengeful spirit fighting against an ancient foe whose tyranny has long laid a crushing yoke upon your race. It is only through wit, skill, and perseverance that anyone could survive against such dread foes. You repay their evil with death, and your training makes you the very best and bravest of any knife-wielding rogue or shadow warrior. You live on the knife’s edge, tempting fate and inviting the wrath of some of the most powerful and vile enemies in all of Toril.<br/><br/><h3>GHOST OF EVENTIDE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadowed Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also become shrouded in shadows, gaining concealment until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Twilight Accuracy (11th level)</b>: Your melee attacks deal 1d6 extra damage when you have concealment or total concealment from the target.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Twilight Vision (16th level)</b>: Your melee attack rolls against targets that have concealment don’t take the normal -2 penalty.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ghost of Eventide Attack 11</span>Shadow Hand Attack</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your blade is everywhere and nowhere at once, and your enemy dies without knowing what hit it.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Special</b>: When you make this attack, also roll a Thievery check opposed by the target’s Perception check.
