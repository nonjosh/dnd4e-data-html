		<h1 class="player">Ward Guardian</h1><p><i>&quot;My warding protects me, but it is more than just a shield. By my will and magic, it can become a deadly force, or a sheltering fortification.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage<br/><br/>In your earliest arcane training, you learned to sheathe yourself in a layer of magical protection. This protection is your Swordmage Warding, and it represents an extension of your arcane mastery. Unlike other swordmages, though, you have taken this talent to the next level.<br/>You have long studied the secrets of the Swordmage Warding, and you have learned that the magical field is more flexible than most swordmages assume it to be. You have discovered that you can shape and sculpt your warding. Through careful study, you have learned to transform the warding into a protective barrier for your allies and into a dangerous weapon to distract or strike foes.<br/><br/><h3>WARD GUARDIAN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Guardian's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, any allies you can see gain the benefit of your Swordmage Warding until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spellshield (11th level)</b>: When you become bloodied, choose a defense other than AC. Until you are no longer bloodied, your Swordmage Warding grants a bonus to the chosen defense as well as to AC.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reactive Spellshield (16th level)</b>: Any allies within 5 squares of you gain the benefit of your Swordmage Warding against opportunity attacks.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ward Guardian Attack 11</span>Ward Force Assault</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You swing at your foe and craft your warding into a blunt force that flattens your enemy when you hit.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Force</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Intelligence modifier damage.
