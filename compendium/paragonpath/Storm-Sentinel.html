		<h1 class="player">Storm Sentinel</h1><p><i>&quot;Feel the wrath of the storm unleashed, for I am nature’s champion and none shall stand against me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>To many, there is no clearer expression of the power of nature than the raging fury of the storm. Churning clouds, crashing thunder, and blasting lightning are manifestations of the rage coursing through the world when its natural laws are violated and its purity corrupted. When gods or primordials overstep their bounds, when demons or aberrant beings try to tear the fabric of reality, the fury of a storm—and its cleansing rain—are part of nature’s response.<br/>Most wardens draw power from the earth. As an incarnation of the storm’s wrath, your greatest primal power comes from the sky. Lightning flows in your veins, and thunder booms in your footsteps. As you advance along this path, you can transform yourself into wind and rain and can ultimately take on the aspect of storm’s wrath.<br/><br/><h3>STORM SENTINEL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Critical Jolt (11th level)</b>: Whenever you score a critical hit, it deals extra lightning damage equal to your Strength modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Invigorating Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can spend a healing surge as a free action after the attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Undying Wind (16th level)</b>: Whenever you spend a healing surge, you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Storm Sentinel Attack 11</span>Thunder Smash</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your weapon rumbles with thunder as you swing it toward the earth in a tremendous smash that knocks your foes down.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier thunder damage, and you knock the target prone.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Storm Sentinel Utility 12</span>Storm Step</h1><p class="flavor"><i>For a brief moment, you transform into wind and rain.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You become insubstantial until the end of your next turn.
