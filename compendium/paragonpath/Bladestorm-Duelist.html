		<h1 class="player">Bladestorm Duelist</h1><p><i>&quot;Your armor, your weapon: These are the instruments of your defeat.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, Tempest Technique class feature, proficient with rapier<br/><br/>Blessed with keen reflexes and stunning speed, you never developed a taste for heavy armor and cumbersome weaponry. You felt it was far more effective to dispense with the weighty gear so that you could stay fast on your feet, dance around your opponents, and deliver swift strikes every bit as nasty as a single blow from a greataxe. Other fighters might scoff at your thin rapier and your parrying dagger, but you wipe their smiles off their faces when you duck beneath their attacks and stick your blades in gaps between their armor.<br/><br/><h3>BLADESTORM DUELIST  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Canny Defense (11th level)</b>: While wearing light armor and not using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex.  You gain a bonus to your initiative checks equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Precise Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can reroll one or two attack rolls (but must use the new result).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bladestorm Technique (16th level)</b>: While wielding a rapier and an off-hand light blade, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with your rapier, and any rapier you use gains the high crit property.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bladestorm Duelist Attack 11</span>Blade Feint</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Leading with your off-hand weapon, you draw your opponents’ attention from the real threat.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding two melee weapons.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC (off-hand weapon)</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you make a secondary attack with combat advantage against the same target.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC (main weapon)</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage.
