		<h1 class="player">Dark Watcher</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Good or lawful good alignment<br/><br/>The ancient order of the dark watchers was founded by arcanists who mastered the power of shadow, then matched that power with a righteous understanding of the light of life and the Astral Sea. As a dark watcher, you are a vigilant guardian of the light of life and the natural world. The power taught to you by the order grants you unmatched defensive prowess, allowing you to protect yourself and your allies from the forces of darkness. Only by embracing the shadow can its corruption be turned to light—or so you believe.<br/><br/><h3>DARK WATCHER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Call for Vigilance (11th level)</b>: You gain the call for vigilance power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Righteous Beacon (11th level)</b>: Whenever you spend an action point, you can choose to project bright light out to 5 squares until the end of your next turn.
