		<h1 class="player">Doomspeaker</h1><p><i>&quot;The end of your days is here, for the strongest enemy you have ever faced stands before you. Your doom lives within me.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shadar-kai<br/><br/>The crowing moot of the shadar-kai is your playground, where your myth is in the making. Your accomplishments are known among your peers and written indelibly on your body. Words have you woven before your equals and lessers, telling the story of what you have done and where you have gone. Ever have you emerged undefeated. Doubt you’ve rebuffed with proof, perhaps even a gory show of strength. In the face of your enemies, you speak of their last moments and your inevitable victory. Maybe you even learn all you can about your greatest foes, telling them how the twisted path of history has led them into your reach and, ultimately, to doom. You have mastered the art of crowing to the level of the mystical. Oaths and boasts you make carry with them the fearsome shadow of fate. Adversaries quail before your bold speech, and your allies know what you say is a promise, not a hope. You’re proof that bragging isn’t really bragging if what you say is true.<br/><br/><h3>DOOMSPEAKER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fearmonger (11th level)</b>: Whenever you make an attack with a power that has the Rattling keyword, the target still suffers the Rattling effect even if your attack misses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rattling Action (11th level)</b>: Whenever you spend an action point to make an extra attack, the attack power you use is considered to have the Rattling keyword.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Thrive on Fear (16th level)</b>: When you use a power that has the Rattling keyword and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you can immediately spend a healing surge as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Doomspeaker Attack 11</span>Unnerving Boast</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your terrifying avowal echoes in the hollow and short future your enemies now expect as you come for them.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psychic</b>, <b>Rattling</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: When you bloody a foe, or reduce a foe to 0 hp</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma +4 vs. Will.</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Special</b>: Increase to Charisma +6 vs. Will at 21st level.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Charisma modifier psychic damage.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Doomspeaker Utility 12</span>Quickened Coercion</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With hateful glares, biting words, and bloody evidence, you quickly cow your foes and prove their inferiority.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fear</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You can make an Intimidate check against an enemy’s Will defense.
