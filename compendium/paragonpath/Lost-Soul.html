		<h1 class="player">Lost Soul</h1><p><i>&quot;They say my soul is lost. I say it’s not too late for me to win it back.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling, any arcane class<br/><br/>The nobility of ancient Bael Turath made certain promises in exchange for power, but your compact with hell is something new. To put it bluntly, you’ve sold your soul for power. Deep in the Nine Hells, an archdevil holds a contract willingly signed in your hand with your blood.<br/><br/>At the time, the bargain seemed like a good idea: trade away something with no material worth for secrets of arcane power. But the more you learn, the more you worry that you’ve underestimated the value of what you gave up.<br/><br/>Many have forsaken you, perhaps even some of your own friends. But you hold out hope that you can change the destined tragic ending of your story. After all, you helped write it, so why can’t you alter the tale? If nothing else, you’ll use the power you’ve been given to make the collection of your soul more costly than the holder of the contract expects it to be.<br/><br/><h3>LOST SOUL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Infernal Retribution (11th level)</b>: Whenever you take ongoing damage, choose an enemy that you can see within 10 squares.
