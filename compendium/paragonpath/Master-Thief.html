		<h1 class="player">Master Thief</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Thief<br/><br/>To a thief in the paragon tier, mundane guardians, traps, and locks are the stuff of mockery. In any human or dwarven city, there are few items you could not have if you wanted them. Your attention now turns to far greater quarry: treasures lost to time, and riches sealed away by titans, demon lords, and worse.<br/><br/><h3>MASTER THIEF  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Level 11 Improved Backstab (11th level)</b>: You gain one more use of backstab per encounter, but you can still use it only once per turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Masterful Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to use an attack power, you can deal your Sneak Attack damage to a target of the power regardless of whether you hit it or whether you have dealt Sneak Attack damage to it this turn, but you must have combat advantage against the target.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Masterful Cunning (11th level)</b>: Once during your first turn in an encounter, you can shift up to 3 squares as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fading Retreat (12th level)</b>: You gain the fading retreat power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow Striker (16th level)</b>: If you are hidden when you make an attack against an enemy, you remain hidden after the attack if you have any cover or concealment.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Thief's Advantage (20th level)</b>: Reroll any Sneak Attack damage die that has a result of 1 until you get a 2 or higher.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Master Thief Utility 12</span>Fading Retreat</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your enemy closes in, you slip into the shadows and out of its sight.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy you can see enters a square adjacent to you.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You shift up to half your speed.
