		<h1 class="player">Adept of Whispers</h1><p><i>&quot;The wise know that one cannot speak and listen at the same time.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Invoker<br/><br/>The words of creation can bend the elements to your desires, but the words of mortal speech also have power to create or destroy. Far better to listen instead of speak, to seek the wisdom that comes with quiet understanding. You speak sparingly and softly, and you choose your words with great care. By husbanding the power of your voice for the words of creation, you ensure that your mind and soul are focused on the powerful prayers you utter.<br/><br/><h3>ADEPT OF WHISPERS  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Adept's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with divine powers, and you can increase the size of your divine blasts or bursts by 1. These benefits last until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Silent Presence (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Stealth checks, Insight checks, and Intimidate checks, and creatures cannot perceive you with blindsight or tremorsense. You take a -2 penalty to Bluff checks and Diplomacy checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Raised Voice (16th level)</b>: When you use a divine attack power, you can choose to raise your voice before you make any attack rolls for it. For that attack, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20, and enemies take a -2 penalty to saving throws against the attack’s effects. However, you are dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Adept of Whispers Attack 11</span>Admonishing Whisper</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You whisper a single word of power, and your enemies reel back from its might, deafened by it and admonished to do no more harm to your friends.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d6 + Wisdom modifier damage, and you push the target 2 squares.
