		<h1 class="player">Euphonic Bow</h1><p><i>&quot;Each arrow’s release plucks the string of my lethal instrument. My bow sings a dirge for your passing.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Bard<br/><br/>You intertwine music, archery, and magic into a single glorious craft that is as artistic as it is martial. Your foes waver between fear and admiration even as you draw a bead on them. Every shot from your bowstring resonates with a melodious tone, and the percussion of your arrows finding their marks drives the battle forward like a drumbeat. Even your foes’ cries of pain blend with the clash of weapons against shields and armor. Your arcane might weaves it all into a fantastic symphony of battle.<br/>Creating this wondrous performance depends partially on your ability to see an instant into the future. Timing is everything.<br/><br/><h3>EUPHONIC BOW  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bow Implement (11th level)</b>: You can use a bow as an implement for your bard attack powers. Add the bow’s enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when using the bow as an implement. You do not add your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when you use your bow as an implement.<br/>When you use a bow as an implement for a ranged bard attack power, the power’s range is increased to the bow’s normal range (if the power’s range is shorter). You can also use the power at the bow’s long range, with the normal -2 penalty to the attack roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Harmonic Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally you choose within 10 squares of you can make a basic attack as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Volley Fire (16th level)</b>: If you score a critical hit with a ranged bard attack power, you can make a ranged basic attack against the target as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Euphonic Bow Attack 11</span>Arrow of Cacophony</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your shot releases a blast of sound that overwhelms your foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Charisma modifier thunder damage, and the target is deafened and dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Euphonic Bow Utility 12</span>Song of Sonic Striking</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You hum a low tone that reverberates in the air, warping the flight of your arrows so that they speed true to their marks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, your attacks with a bow ignore cover and concealment, including superior cover but not total concealment.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Euphonic Bow Attack 20</span>Anthem of Antagonism</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your foe’s offenses return to it as a wailing storm that engulfs its allies while your bow shots repay its evil deeds in full.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 4[W] + Charisma modifier thunder damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target is affected by your anthem of antagonism (save ends).
