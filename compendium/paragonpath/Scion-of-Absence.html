		<h1 class="player">Scion of Absence</h1><p><i>&quot;Think on the time after you die. It is the same world, distinguished only in that you no longer exist. Do you see how you cannot fight an absence, yet it can be responsible for your demise?&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, voidsoul elemental manifestation<br/><br/>What is, the void consumes. To attack the void is of the utmost futility, because it has no point of weakness, no vulnerability, and nothing to sever or destroy.<br/><br/>The scion of absence studies and learns from the voidsoul association with the inverted fundament: the lack of all things. Most are philosophic warriors or masters of magic, seeking the nonaction that achieves their goals. Others resemble destructive forces of nature that no one can easily stop.<br/><br/><h3>SCION OF ABSENCE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nonbeing Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can end one effect you currently have that a save can end.
