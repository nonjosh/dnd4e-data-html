		<h1 class="player">Basilisk's Fury Adept</h1><p><i>&quot;Look into these eyes and see the doom awaiting you.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Monk<br/><br/>The basilisk is renowned for its hunting prowess, and its pitiless gaze. Inspired by both the basilisk’s sinuous movements and the immobilizing effect of its gaze, a group of monks have developed disciplines that mirror this creature’s fearsome reputation.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your study of the basilisk’s fury has opened your mind to the emotions around and in you. Achieving this state empties your body of thought and draws the sensations of others through your eyes. Foes that peer into your obsidian gaze are drained of hope. All that remains for your enemy are apathy, stasis, and death.<br/><br/><h3>BASILISK'S FURY ADEPT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Baleful Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to slow each enemy within 5 squares of you that can see you until the start of your next turn. Any enemy that takes damage while slowed in this way becomes slowed (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Basilisk's Boon (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects that immobilize, restrain, or slow. When you are subjected to an effect that petrifies you, you can make a saving throw against that effect. If you save, the effect ends on you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Basilisk's Fury (16th level)</b>: When you score a critical hit against an enemy using a monk or basilisk’s fury adept attack power, that enemy is petrified (save ends).<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Basilisk's Fury Adept Attack 11</span>Eyes of the Basilisk [Attack Technique]</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You drive your enemy back, then bind it in place with a gaze.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Full Discipline</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d12 + Dexterity modifier damage, and you push the target 3 squares.
