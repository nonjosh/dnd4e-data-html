		<h1 class="player">Blade Banshee</h1><p><i>&quot;That hum is the sound of your death approaching.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin, ranger<br/><br/>The Feywild sings with eldritch energy. It is infused with magic from its twilight sky to its sparkling depths. Fey  creatures, its children, are bathed in its supernatural flow. Even the simplest among them have powers beyond those of worldly mortals, bestowing simple tasks with an otherworldly enchantment.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eladrin are among the heritors of the Feywild’s nature. As humans and other races tamed portions of the world, so too did the eladrin subdue parts of the Feywild according to their fey temperament. They evolved a complex society, rich in crafts and traditions that also sing in concordance with the Feywild. As followers of mores inspired in elder days by the god Corellon, eladrin treat life and all its aspects as an art. Everything they do, wonderful or wicked, reflects this ideal.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like their counterparts in the world, eladrin have had to fight and die to defend their way of life. Each eladrin learns to wield the longsword, the traditional weapon of the eladrin people. They have martial disciplines that teach an eladrin to channel the innate magic in his or her spirit, as well as that stored within the elements.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blade from the Feywild or crafted by eladrin hands has a special beauty. The metal vibrates with bizarre potential. Some eladrin learn to make steel shaped into such a blade sing its heart’s song. That song is a fey cry that portends loss of life, and those who wield it are known across the cosmos as blade banshees.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, you’ve developed a terrifying synergy with your blades. You understand the secret heart of fey-crafted steel. Its unmistakable, dread voice announces your displeasure. As you fight, your blades buzz and keen, unleashing rending vibrations against your foes. But when your soul is bent to friendship or mercy, your swords hum with your own gentleness, briefly bringing a bit of peace to others before shrieking into battle once again.<br/><br/><h3>BLADE BANSHEE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Banshee's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action while wielding two melee weapons, any enemy adjacent to you takes thunder damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bladed Disruption (11th level)</b>: While you’re wielding two melee weapons, any creature you hit with more than one of your melee attacks during your turn takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shrieking Blades (16th level)</b>: While you’re wielding two melee weapons, your melee attacks deal extra thunder damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Blade Banshee Attack 11</span>Steel Scream</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You clash your blades together, unleashing a mind-numbing screech.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a longsword and another melee weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier thunder damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Blade Banshee Utility 12</span>Soothing Reverberation</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With a soft sweep, your blades purr, reaching out to the minds of nearby allies and revitalizing them.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a longsword and another melee weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Each target can spend a healing surge either to regain hit points or to negate being dazed or stunned.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Blade Banshee Attack 20</span>Mind-Bending Blades</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You use your blades to set up a fey harmonic pattern, allowing you to control your target until you unleash the sound in a disruptive wail.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Charm</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Reliable</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a longsword and another melee weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target is dominated (save ends).
