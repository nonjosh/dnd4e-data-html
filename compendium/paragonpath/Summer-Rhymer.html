		<h1 class="player">Summer Rhymer</h1><p><i>&quot;Ancient rhythms, endlessly refreshed. This blade cuts like a poem.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Bard, Virtue of Cunning class feature<br/><br/>Among the most powerful residents of the Feywild is Tiandra, the Summer Queen (see Manual of the Planes). Her court is a reflection of her unearthly beauty, hung with flower garlands and alive with bustling activity. Her smile can ripen crops, and her favor bestowed on a mortal can quicken the gifts of song and poetry.<br/>Whether the Summer Queen has actually smiled on you or you merely aspire to seek her blessing, you claim some association with the Summer Fey and study their musical magic. In your feytouched presence, you and your allies teleport freely, and you can call on the Summer Queen’s powers of growth to aid your own healing powers.<br/>If you serve the Summer Queen well, you might hope to receive some favor from her. Great heroes of the past have sometimes received noble titles, magic instruments, access to powerful enchantments, and other gifts from her hand. As the fey go, the Summer Queen is relatively trustworthy, but be warned: No fey gift is truly free.<br/><br/><h3>SUMMER RHYMER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feypath (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you teleport yourself or an ally adjacent to you 5 squares as a free action before or after the extra action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Queen's Grace (11th level)</b>: Whenever you grant healing with a bard healing power, add your Charisma modifier to the hit points regained by each target.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Judgment of the Summer Court (16th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy’s missed attack triggers your Virtue of Cunning class feature, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Summer Rhymer Attack 11</span>Song of the Queen's Protection</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You sing a melody of eldritch quality that assaults your foe’s senses while causing wisps of light to blur the outlines of your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and until the end of your next turn, any ally within 10 squares of you gains concealment until the end of his or her next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Summer Rhymer Utility 12</span>Song of Spiral Paths</h1><p class="flavor"><i>This song weaves qualities of the Feywild into the air, causing space to bend around you and your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of fey magic that lasts until the end of your next turn.
