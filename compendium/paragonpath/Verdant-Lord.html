		<h1 class="player">Verdant Lord</h1><p><i>&quot;I am one with the forest, and the forest is one with me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>Like the trees of the forest, you draw strength from the loamy earth, from the water that spills from the sky and flows across the land, and from the radiance of the sun. You embrace the essence of the tree, becoming the forestâ€™s protector, its champion against those that would despoil it. When you use your primal powers, shoots of new growth emerge from the ground, flowers bloom, and trees straighten with renewed vigor.<br/>You favor guardian form powers that let you take on treelike forms (such as form of the willow sentinel, form of the oak sentinel, and form of the rowan sentinel), but even when you take on other aspects, the earth responds with growth. As the culmination of this path, you can take on a form like that of a treant, smashing foes and objects alike with a weapon held in your branchlike fists.<br/><br/><h3>VERDANT LORD  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reaching Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action while you are in a guardian form, your melee reach increases by 1 until the end of your turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Writhing Roots (11th level)</b>: While you are in a guardian form, enemies treat each square adjacent to you as difficult terrain, and each ally adjacent to you gains a +1 bonus to AC.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Iron Boughs (16th level)</b>: When you hit an enemy with a melee attack and the enemy is marked by you, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Verdant Lord Attack 11</span>Falling Tree Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As the tree falls and crushes all beneath it, your weapon smashes down to knock your foe off its feet.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you knock the target prone.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Verdant Lord Utility 12</span>Awaken the Forest</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Vines burst from the ground around you to hinder your foes.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of thick vines that lasts until the end of your next turn.
