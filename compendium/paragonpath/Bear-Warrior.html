		<h1 class="player">Bear Warrior</h1><p><i>&quot;The bear’s power and strength are my guides. The bear’s form is my weapon of choice.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian<br/><br/>You revere the bear as a symbol of the warrior’s strength and prowess. Through long and ancient rites, you have bound that symbol to your heart with more than just words and totems. In battle, you become the bear, shaping your form to its form and your strength to its strength.<br/>Most bear warriors strive to emulate the bear beyond combat situations. You might catch fish with your bare hands, tear open beehives to feast on the honey inside, or roar in an aggressive territorial display. Like many barbarians, you’re more at home in the wild places of the world than when surrounded by buildings.<br/><br/><h3>BEAR WARRIOR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bear Form (11th level)</b>: As a bear warrior, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form. While you are raging, you take on a bearlike appearance. Your head becomes that of a bear, your body sprouts thick fur, and your hands become heavy claws. Until the rage ends, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and can use your second wind as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bear's Toughness (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also spend a healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wild Push (16th level)</b>: Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack while you are raging, you push the target a number of squares equal to your Strength modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bear Warrior Attack 11</span>Mauling Bear</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You channel the bear’s strength into a powerful blow that knocks your opponent to the ground.
