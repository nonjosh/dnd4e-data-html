		<h1 class="player">Oman Giantkiller</h1><p><i>&quot;They bleed right? Then we can kill ‘em. That’s all you need to know.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter and hunter’s quarry class feature, Moonshae Isles regional benefit<br/><br/>You were trained by a clan of Northlanders who have developed specialized tactics for giantslaying. Although their purpose in training you was to aid them in liberating the isle of Oman, you’ve found that their techniques are very applicable to other enemies as well. In addition to learning how to effectively fight giants, the Northlanders taught you a bit about sailing and the sea.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a group, you stay out front, confounding your brutish enemies until you are ready to strike a killing blow. You are willing to take calculated risks to obtain advantage over your larger foes, and with enough support, you keep your enemies’ attention focused on you. It’s a challenge to go toe-to-toe with heavy hitters all the time, but it’s one you relish.<br/><br/><h3>OMAN GIANTKILLER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In the Thick of the Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you deal 4 extra damage against Large or larger enemies and gain +2 speed until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Northlander Persistence (11th level)</b>: When you take the second wind action, you can spend one additional healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>One More Time (16th level)</b>: Whenever you designate a target that is not currently your quarry as your quarry, that target is marked by you until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Oman Giantkiller Attack 11</span>Toss and Close</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You throw your weapon at the target, rapidly close the ground between you and it, and get in a quick melee attack.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a light thrown or heavy thrown weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: After the attack is resolved, move your speed toward the target of your ranged attack; you can draw one melee weapon during this movement.
