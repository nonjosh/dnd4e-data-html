		<h1 class="player">Shadowblade</h1><p><i>&quot;The dark is my weapon.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Assassin<br/><br/>You are a shadowblade, an assassin capable of crafting the raw stuff of the night into a deadly weapon. At your command, the shadows twist and sway. With a gesture, you can craft a shadowblade, a weapon of pure darkness that is as sharp as any blade of steel. As long as a shadow is near you, you are never unarmed.<br/><br/>With your shadowblade, you can slice the raw stuff of a foe’s shadow. With each cut, you extract part of that essence, and at a foe’s death you can infuse that shadow with a magical effect. At your command, the shadows you have harvested appear as looming shades to distract a foe, swirl around you to shield you from sight, or reach forth like hungry apparitions to douse torches and lanterns.<br/><br/><h3>SHADOWBLADE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Master of Shadows (Shadowblade) (11th level)</b>: When you reduce any enemy to 0 hit points with your shadowblade, you gain a gloom shard. As a minor action, you can expend a gloom shard to gain one of the following effects. <br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain combat advantage against an adjacent enemy until the end of your turn.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain a +5 bonus to the next Stealth check you make this turn.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You douse a light source until the end of your next turn. The light source must be within 10 squares of you and must be no larger than a lantern.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can have up to five gloom shards at a time. After an extended rest, your unexpended gloom shards vanish, but you gain a gloom shard.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadowblade Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain combat advantage for all your attacks until the end of your turn, and as your last action of the turn, you can teleport 10 squares as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Weapon of the Night (11th level)</b>: As a minor action, you can create a shadowblade.
