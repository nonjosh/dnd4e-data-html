		<h1 class="player">Umbral Cabalist</h1><p><i>&quot;I have seen into the darkest abyss and made its power my own. I fear nothing of this world.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock, vestige pact<br/><br/>Centuries ago, a powerful covenant of warlocks known as the Umbral Cabal summoned a demon lord to do its bidding. The demon, known as Kulnoghrim the Terrible, committed such horrific deeds of carnage and madness that it became too much for the warlocks to bear. The group bound the fiend by using a forbidden ritual, destroying themselves in the process and leaving Kulnoghrim to languish into obscurity.<br/><br/>By studying their methods, you gain the ability to ward yourself from attack and bind your foes as this cabal did the great demon lord. With each secret you uncover, you grow closer to accomplishing what they could not: gaining the ability to bind Kulnoghrim as a vestige and unleashing his demonic fury to burn your enemies and drive them mad.<br/><br/><h3>UMBRAL CABALIST  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cabalist's Warding (11th level)</b>: When you become bloodied, you gain a bonus to your choice of Fortitude, Reflex, or Will equal to your Constitution modifier until you are no longer bloodied.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Restricting Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, you restrain one enemy affected by your Warlock’s Curse until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demonic Resilience (16th level)</b>: The first time you take typed damage in each encounter, you gain resist 10 to that damage type until the end of the encounter.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Umbral Cabalist Attack 11</span>Command of the Abyss</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Calling forth lore that bound the powerful demon Kulnoghrim, you rend your foe’s mind and leave it less able to ward off outside influences.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Constitution vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d6 + Constitution psychic damage, and you stun the target until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Umbral Cabalist Utility 12</span>Clarifying Rebuke</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You rally your will, calling upon the secrets of the cabal’s Grand Jailer to stay in control.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An effect dominates you, or you are subject to a charm or fear effect that a save can end</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The triggering effect doesn’t affect you.
