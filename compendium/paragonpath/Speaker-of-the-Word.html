		<h1 class="player">Speaker of the Word</h1><p><i>&quot;It is simple to speak the Word. Knowing how and when to use the Word—and how to ease your conscience after you unleash its power—is more complex.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Invoker<br/><br/>You are an initiate in a rare tradition, one that embraces a unified religious concept summed up in one word of power. The Word was crafted by the gods to be a great weapon. Only the most trustworthy and compassionate invokers are taught the syllables of the Word, and even they seldom use its power. Each syllable, when spoken in the proper pitch and cadence, is a powerful prayer in its own right, and those brief tones are the most powerful weapons of your faith.<br/><br/>It is not enough simply to repeat the syllables that comprise the Word; to unleash its power you must desire to do so, speaking it exactly and framing the philosophical significance of each syllable in your mind as you say it. Uttering the Word unleashes dangerous divine energy, and even speakers of the Word dare not utter it in a voice louder than a whisper.<br/><br/><h3>SPEAKER OF THE WORD  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Influencing Syllable (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma-based skill checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Speaker's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also reroll one die you roll during the same turn for an attack roll, a damage roll, a skill check, or a saving throw and use either result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Empowering Syllable (16th level)</b>: After you use a speaker of the Word power, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Speaker of the Word Attack 11</span>Syllable of Light</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You whisper an otherworldly tone, and lights swirl around you, blinding your foes and surrounding your allies in cloaks of radiance.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d8 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage, and the target is blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Each ally in the burst gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses and resist 5 radiant until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Speaker of the Word Utility 12</span>Guiding Syllable</h1><p class="flavor"><i>A syllable of the Word is enough to guide others’ steps.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You slide the target a number of squares equal to your Intelligence modifier.
