		<h1 class="player">Spiral Wind's Ally</h1><p><i>&quot;Stillness is death. Touch the wind and live.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid<br/><br/>Many of the world’s languages use words for “spirit” and “breath” that are related to each other. Whereas other primal magicians mostly consort with the spirits behind the world’s creatures and things, you have befriended one of the ancient winds. The Spiral Wind carries the secrets of life in its twists; look at any humanoid fingerprint, and you’ll see the spirals that mark where the wind entered to give the person life.<br/><br/>You have learned to call the Spiral Wind when you and your allies have need of its healing powers. You won’t be mistaken for a cleric or a shaman, but your allies have learned that a sudden breeze might be a sign of your allied wind’s arrival.<br/><br/>The Spiral Wind has more to do with the people of the wilderness than with the beasts, and you are more comfortable in humanoid form than in beast form. You can still change shape, but most of the powers and features that rely on the Spiral Wind work only when you are in your humanoid form.<br/><br/><h3>SPIRAL WIND'S ALLY  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Healing Spiral (11th level)</b>: While you are not in beast form, any bloodied ally within 5 squares of you who spends a healing surge regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spiral Wind Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action and you are not in beast form, a bloodied ally within 5 squares of you can spend a healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Allied Winds (16th level)</b>: When you spend a healing surge, you can shift 2 squares as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Spiral Wind's Ally Attack 11</span>Spiral Gust</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your wind blasts in crisscrossing funnels, whipping into your enemies and granting your allies renewed breath.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d6 + Wisdom modifier damage, and an ally adjacent to the target regains hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Spiral Wind's Ally Utility 12</span>Releasing Breath</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your friend catches his or her breath, wind gusts past, making you and your allies harder to see.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An ally within 10 squares of you uses his or her second wind</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering ally</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target and each ally within 5 squares of him or her gain concealment until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Spiral Wind's Ally Attack 20</span>Three Shifting Winds</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The Spiral Wind calls on its cold or thunderous cousins to help you or takes its spiral path one twist further and explodes into radiance.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Varies</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class="flavor"><b>Special</b>: Choose cold, radiant, or thunder whenever you use this power.
