		<h1 class="player">Ninefold Master</h1><p><i>&quot;I have mastered a study of magic that was ancient when your kind were barbarians at our feet.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, any arcane class, Draconic Spellcaster.<br/><br/>In ancient Arkhosia, arcane spellcasters studied the Ninefold Path, a way toward both arcane mastery and spiritual awakening. The steps along the path represent an increasing attunement to the draconic energies in the initiate’s being, a practice that unites the study of magic with the innate characteristics of the dragonborn race.<br/>You are a master of the Ninefold Path, on your way toward arcane perfection as the scholars of Arkhosia understood it. Your dragon breath is another spell in your arsenal, and when you use spells that create the same elemental force as your breath, you demonstrate mastery over the magic that powers them.<br/><br/><h3>NINEFOLD MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Breath Expertise (11th level)</b>: Your dragon breath power is considered an arcane power belonging to each of your arcane classes. If you are wielding an implement you can use for your arcane powers, you may add the implement’s enhancement bonus to the damage rolls for your dragon breath power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dragon Breath Action (Ninefold Master) (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also use your dragon breath as a free action, even if you have already expended it in this encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Draconic Resistance (16th level)</b>: Choose one damage type you can deal with your dragon breath power. You gain resistance to that damage type equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ninefold Master Attack 11</span>Dragon Aura</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The innate energy of your draconic breath forms a shield around you, pushing your enemies away.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Varies</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence or Charisma vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d6 + Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier damage, and push the target 1 square.

In the Target entry, replace “in blast” with “in burst.” <br/><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ninefold Master Utility 12</span>Countering Breath</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your foe unleashes a blast of elemental power, you release your own, subtly altering your draconic breath to negate your enemy’s attack.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy targets you with a close or area attack that deals a damage type you can deal with dragon breath</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Your space and the blast are not considered part of the triggering attack’s area of effect.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Ninefold Master Attack 20</span>Dragon Tempest</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your exhalation of elemental energy transforms into a swirling vortex of power.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Varies</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence or Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d8 + Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier damage.

A creature that enters or starts its turn in the zone takes 10 damage of the same type as the initial attack's damage (a creature can take this damage only once per turn). As a move action, you can move the zone 3 squares.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: The zone persists.</p><br/>Update (2/17/2012)<br/>Changed in December 2011 updates.<br/><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251200000" target="_new">Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn</a>, page(s) 12.</p>
