		<h1 class="player">Warrior of Spring</h1><p><i>&quot;With spring, there is always hope.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power<br/><br/>The power of spring is in its ability to bring rebirth and hope. A warrior of spring wields this power to great effect, whether as a healer or a guardian of the primal world. As a shaman who follows this path, you are gifted with powers of primal healing beyond those of most other shamans. Your presence can allow allies to recover from the most grievous injury, or even from death itself.<br/><br/>Although you pride yourself in watching over your community, when adventure or the duty of a great cause calls, you are ready to act. You can heal your allies or instill hope in them, and the spirits you call on can help you defeat the greatest of threats.<br/><br/>As you go on adventures, your duty as a warrior of spring is clear. You carry a bundle of seeds gathered from across the lands. No matter what desolate realm you find yourself in, you’re ready to scatter those seeds through it so that their verdant bounty can continue the cycle of spring.<br/><br/><h3>WARRIOR OF SPRING  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Revitalizing Presence (11th level)</b>: When you use a primal power to allow an ally to spend a healing surge, that ally regains 1d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Warrior of Spring Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one bloodied ally within 5 squares of you can spend a healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spring's Vigor (16th level)</b>: When you use a primal power to allow an ally to spend a healing surge, that ally can also spend an action point to take an extra action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Warrior of Spring Attack 11</span>Spring's Dawning</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The light of spring erupts from the spirit world, searing your foes and providing a beacon of hope to your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Radiant</b>, <b>Spirit</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst spirit 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d6 + Wisdom modifier radiant damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: The first time you hit a target when you use this power, each ally can make a saving throw with a +2 power bonus.</p><br/>Update (2/8/2010)<br/>Delete the second sentence of the Hit entry. Add an Effect entry below the Hit entry that reads: “Effect: The first time you hit a target when you use this power, each ally can make a saving throw with a +2 power bonus.” The power’s intent is to grant a saving throw to each ally once. As a close attack, the effect on the Hit entry might trigger multiple times. This change ensures that the effect occurs only once each time you use the power.<br/><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Warrior of Spring Utility 12</span>Hope Beyond Death</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Although winter might empty fields, cast leaves from trees, and freeze rivers, the world blooms anew at spring’s return.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An ally within 10 squares of you fails a death saving throw</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering ally</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target is considered to have rolled a 20 for the death saving throw.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Warrior of Spring Attack 20</span>Spring's Resurgence</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call forth the power of spring’s resurgence, lending strength to your allies with the demise of each enemy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 2 within 10 squares</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 10 squares of you drops to 0 hit points</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst centered on the triggering enemy</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 5d6 + Wisdom modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of verdure that lasts until the end of the encounter.
