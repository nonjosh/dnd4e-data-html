		<h1 class="player">Nightmare Weaver</h1><p><i>&quot;I am the chill in your blood, the raised hairs on your neck, the thudding heartbeat brought on by your worst dreams. I am death, and I come for you.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock class, trained in Intimidate<br/><br/>You use power drawn from your pact to expose your enemies’ doubts and fears, using these terrors as your weapons. You might visit retribution on those who serve evil and destruction, or you might be a ruthless killer, hunting down those who offend you. Regardless, you are a creature of nightmare—a thing of the shadows—and those who earn your ire can know only a terrifying end.<br/><br/><h3>NIGHTMARE WEAVER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Insidious Curse (11th level)</b>: When an enemy under your Warlock’s Curse drops to 0 hit points, you can place a Warlock’s Curse on the enemy nearest to you as an immediate reaction. If the nearest enemy is already affected by your Warlock’s Curse, you can slide it 2 squares, and it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nightmarish Action (11th level)</b>: Whenever you spend an action point to make an attack, you can slide creatures affected by your Warlock’s Curse 1 square. Those you slide take a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shaking Displays (16th level)</b>: All your warlock encounter attack spells, along with painful delusion below, gain the rattling keyword.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Nightmare Weaver Attack 11</span>Painful Delusion</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You sink a psychic claw into your opponent’s mind, awakening its worst fears.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.
