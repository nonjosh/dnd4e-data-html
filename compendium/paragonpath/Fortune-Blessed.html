You have long proved a constant and loyal servant to Avandra by making her interests your own in your ongoing struggle against tyranny and in your willingness to explore the world and sample all it has to offer. Your virtuous soul and good works have won you the goddess’s favor, and although you know you were ever in her good graces, you realize you have only touched upon what is possible in her service.<br/><br/>Becoming fortune blessed makes luck your servant, yours to shape and manipulate as you desire. The goddess permits this mastery as long as you advance her aims in the world and remain pure of heart and purpose. You have a knack for husbanding your good fortune and turning setbacks to your advantage. The greater your power becomes, the more the impossible becomes possible until one day you find there is nothing you can’t achieve with luck on your side.<br/><br/><h3>FORTUNE BLESSED  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Avandra's Luck (11th level)</b>: Whenever you roll a natural 1 or 20 on an attack roll or saving throw during an encounter, you gain 1 luck token.
