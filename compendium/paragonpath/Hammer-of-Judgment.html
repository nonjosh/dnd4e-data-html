		<h1 class="player">Hammer of Judgment</h1><p><i>&quot;The hammer of the smith must sometimes also be the hammer of the warrior.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger<br/><br/>As the blacksmith’s hammer shapes metal according to the smith’s will, so you have been sent to shape the world to your god’s will. A tool and a weapon in your god’s hand, you are called to shape the course of kingdoms and punish those who stand opposed to the ways of your god. Although the smith’s hammer is a tool of building and creation, in time of need it can also be a weapon of destruction.<br/>In following this path, you emphasize the control elements of many avenger powers, particularly pulling, pushing, sliding, and teleporting your foes. You gain abilities that let you push your foes even with powers that don’t normally involve forced movement and that increase the distance you move your foes with your powers. Your new attack powers push your targets around or knock them to the ground.<br/>True to the name of this path, you are most effective if you are wielding a hammer, such as a maul.<br/><br/><h3>HAMMER OF JUDGMENT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Avalanche Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack and that attack hits, you push each target you hit with that attack a number of squares equal to your Intelligence modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bone Crusher (11th level)</b>: Whenever you hit a creature with a daily attack power, that creature takes a -2 penalty to AC until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bloodthirsty Hammer (16th level)</b>: Whenever you pull, push, slide, or teleport a bloodied creature by using a power, you can move the creature an additional 2 squares.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Hammer of Judgment Attack 11</span>Thunder Hammer</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You slam your weapon into the ground, and the earth itself transmits your god’s wrath, bludgeoning your enemies with the force of thunder and either knocking them to the ground or driving them back.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier thunder damage, and you either knock the target prone or push it 2 squares.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Weapon</b>: If you are wielding a hammer, the number of squares you can push the target equals 1 + your Intelligence modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Hammer of Judgment Utility 12</span>Resolve of Steel</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Like steel forged and tempered by a master smith, you resist the worst of your enemies’ attacks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You gain resist 10 to all damage until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Hammer of Judgment Attack 20</span>Hammer of the Final Pronouncement</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your god’s judgment drives your foe back and roots it to the ground.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 4[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.
