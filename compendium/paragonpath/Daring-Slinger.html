		<h1 class="player">Daring Slinger</h1><p><i>&quot;Two birds with one stone . . . how about two drow with one bullet?&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue<br/><br/>The sling is a humble weapon, favored by commoners such as shepherds and farmers. It is useful for chasing off predators and bandits, but it lacks the prestige enjoyed by crossbows and light blades. Despite its lowly stature, the sling has its adherents. Among these enthusiasts, the daring slinger is the most dangerous, for these rogues elevate the simple weapon, making it the equal of any other ranged weapon.<br/><br/>As a daring slinger, you appreciate the weapon’s subtle assets. A sling is small. It can be compressed and hidden. Slings are also resistant to the elements. You can dunk one in water, stretch it, or abuse it, and the weapon continues to work—something that can’t be said of bows and crossbows. Best of all, ammunition is never a problem; any small stone will do.<br/><br/>Through extensive training, you’ve improved your accuracy, exceeding what archers can do with a longbow. Your range is equal to that of a crossbow, and your bullets pack an equal punch.<br/><br/><h3>DARING SLINGER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Concussive Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to attack with a sling, and the attack hits, you treat a damage roll of 1 or 2 as a roll of 3. In addition, the target of the attack is dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sling Mastery (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks that use a sling. This bonus increases to +4 at 21st level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Uncanny Aim (16th level)</b>: You ignore the –2 penalty for attacking with a sling at long range, and you ignore cover provided by an enemy’s allies when you attack with a sling.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Daring Slinger Attack 11</span>Scattershot</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You hurl several stones at once, knocking your enemies back with each strike.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a sling.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One, two, or three creatures</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and you push the target 1 square.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Daring Slinger Utility 12</span>Instructive Miss</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your shot goes wide, but now you have your foe in your sights.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You don’t hit with an encounter attack power using a sling</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You regain the use of the encounter attack power.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Daring Slinger Attack 20</span>Dispersing Shot</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You let fly a forceful shot that shatters armor, flesh, and bone, knocking your enemy senseless.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Reliable</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a sling.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 4[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target is dazed and slowed (save ends both).
