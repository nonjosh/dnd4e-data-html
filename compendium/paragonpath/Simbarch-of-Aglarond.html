		<h1 class="player">Simbarch of Aglarond</h1><p><i>&quot;I have studied under mages who learned from the Simbul herself. Her lore and power have not been forgotten yet.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard<br/><br/>During the long years of her rule, the mysterious Simbul—Witch Queen of Aglarond—took on many apprentices and schooled them in her secrets of power. Although she no longer rules in Aglarond, the apprentices of her apprentices form an elite cadre of spellcasters known as the simbarchs. They keep alive many of the Simbul’s arts and take on new apprentices of their own. You have studied with mages who in turn studied with the Simbul herself.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ruling council of Aglarond is made up of simbarchs, a few of the Simbul’s magical “descendants” are not members of the council and prefer to practice their magic privately. You fall into this group. As a simbarch, you have the right to claim a seat on the council, but doing so entails assuming many serious responsibilities, and there are political considerations. If you decide to join the council, it can take months or even years before you are formally recognized.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not you join the leaders of Aglarond, you wield your magic with a wild abandon that terrifies your enemies. Your arcane power sustains and strengthens you, granting you seemingly superhuman reserves of vitality and health. You practice compassion and restraint, but when the time comes for wrath, you are a terrible enemy indeed.<br/><br/><h3>SIMBARCH OF AGLAROND  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcane Healing (11th level)</b>: Whenever you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also spend a healing surge as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sorcerous Vitality (11th level)</b>: You gain two additional healing surges per day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Determined Mage (16th level)</b>: When you spend a healing surge while you are bloodied, add 1d10 to the amount of hit points you regain.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Simbarch of Aglarond Attack 11</span>Silver Fire</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You summon a jet of pure magical power that burns through all defenses and empowers your other spells.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence +8 vs. Reflex </p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d6 + Intelligence modifier damage, and until the end of the encounter, each subsequent time you hit the target with an attack, it takes additional damage equal to onehalf your level.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Simbarch of Aglarond Utility 12</span>Synostodweomer</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You heal yourself with the ethereal silver fire of pure magic.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally within 20 squares</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Spend one of your own healing surges but regain no hit points.
