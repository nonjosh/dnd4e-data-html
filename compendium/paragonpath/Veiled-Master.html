		<h1 class="player">Veiled Master</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Training in Stealth and Perception<br/><br/>Veiled masters are drawn primarily from the ranks of martial artists who have learned to perceive the world around them with little or no light. In keeping with your veiled master training, you prefer to attack from hiding, either striking from existing shadow or wrapping yourself in the gloom you learn to create. The features of the veiled master path reward those of a stealthy disposition, including monks, rogues, rangers, and other lightly armored warriors.<br/><br/><h3>VEILED MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blindfold Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make a melee or close weapon attack, the first target you hit with that attack is also blinded until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close the Veil (11th level)</b>: Once per round as a minor action, you can douse a nonmagical light source no larger than a small campfire within 10 squares of you. A light source you douse using this power cannot be lit again until the end of the encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Veiled Strike (11th level)</b>: You gain the veiled strike power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Veiled Eyes (12th level)</b>: You gain the veiled eyes power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dark Strike (16th level)</b>: When you attack an enemy you cannot see, you take a -2 penalty to the attack roll instead of a -5 penalty.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maelstrom of Darkness (20th level)</b>: You gain the maelstrom of darkness power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Veiled Master Attack 11</span>Veiled Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You imbue your weapon with the essence of shadow, unleashing it as an inky cloud that quickly surrounds you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength or Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength or Dexterity modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You create a zone in a close burst 2 that lasts until the end of your next turn.
