		<h1 class="player">Umbriri</h1><p><i>&quot;Keen are the blades of shadow.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage<br/><br/>Netherese swordmages are masters of shadow and steel, blending the ancient Netherese warrior arts with their  wizards’ dark arcana. You have trained in the swordmage arts practiced in Netheril, and you have become one of the deadly umbriri. Your skill with a blade blends darkness, magic, and the subtle techniques of the shadowy masters into the perfect killing art.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Netherese do not appreciate their secrets of combat being turned against them. You are hunted by the Shadows within the shadows. They would see you dead before you pass the fell secrets of your art to outsiders. Umbriri loyal to the Netherese wizards despise you, feeling that you dishonor those who spent millennia perfecting this ancient art.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most umbriri are human Netherese, the descendants of those shadowborn humans who returned to Faerûn over a hundred years ago. They serve as the champions and elite guards of the city of Shade Enclave. Others are Sembians who showed promise enough to warrant instruction and were invited to train in the umbriri art. Some of these are secretly loyal to the memory of a free Sembia and hide their disloyalty from their overlords. The most powerful umbriri are ancient shade swordmasters, native-born Shadovars rewarded with transformation into deathless shadows for their skill and loyalty.<br/><br/><h3>UMBRIRI  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and all adjacent allies gain concealment until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow Defense (11th level)</b>: You gain resist necrotic equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you use any swordmage aegis power, this resist value increases by 10, and your melee basic attacks deal 5 extra necrotic damage. These benefits last until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow Shroud (16th level)</b>: You gain combat advantage against an enemy if you also have concealment from that enemy.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Umbriri Attack 11</span>Assassin Shadow</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you strike, shadows congeal into a solid figure at your foe’s flank. The silhouette looks like you, only its features are shrouded in blackness, and its sword is made of inky gloom.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Conjuration</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Intelligence modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You conjure a shadowy manifestation of yourself. This conjuration can appear in any square adjacent to the target. This creature can be used to set up a flanking position and can make opportunity attacks (as though you were making the attacks), but it can take no other actions. The manifestation disappears at the end of your next turn.</p><br/>Update (4/13/2010)<br/>In the Attack entry, replace Strength with Intelligence. <br/><br/>Update (2/8/2010)<br/>On the Hit line, replace Strength with Intelligence. This revision syncs up the ability score modifier of the power’s damage with the swordmage’s primary ability score.<br/><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Umbriri Utility 12</span>Concealing Umbra</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You exert your will over the stuff of shadow and conceal an ally in pure darkness. No light reveals your friend now.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target becomes invisible until he or she attacks, or until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Umbriri Attack 20</span>Shadowed Psyche</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You veil your enemy’s senses in shadowy phantasms. Your foe strikes at imaginary opponents and moves as a puppet on your strings.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Charm</b>, <b>Reliable</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must have combat advantage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: At the start of its next turn, the target is dominated by you until the start of its following turn. You cannot cause it to take any action that will obviously harm it (such as walking off a cliff or into a trap the creature is aware of ). You must be within line of sight of the creature at the start of its turn or you can’t dominate it.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 67.</p>
