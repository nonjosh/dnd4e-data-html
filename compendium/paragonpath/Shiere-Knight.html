		<h1 class="player">Shiere Knight</h1><p><i>&quot;By the court of the Summer Queen, you shall pay for your transgressions!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin<br/><br/>Most noble eladrin, including bralani and ghaeles such as those described in the Monster Manual, are prominent figures in their houses, lords and ladies who have positions of authority over the lesser members of their houses. A few eladrin heroes, however, champion the cause of their race as a whole, rather than of any particular house. Though they are often anointed by house nobles, these shiere knights are free agents, beholden to no particular house and dedicated to protecting the eladrin from fomorians, spriggans, and other hostile denizens of the Feywild.<br/>Becoming a shiere knight involves more than attaining a title. As a champion of your race, you become a living embodiment of the power of the Feywild. Your appearance is marked by a sign of the fey power within you: a faint glow that outlines your frame and burns in your eyes, an eldritch wind that constantly stirs the air around you, or some other manifestation of your otherworldly nature. You can channel this power to beguile your foes or drive them off in fear.<br/><br/><h3>SHIERE KNIGHT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blessed of the Fey (11th level)</b>: Whenever you are affected by a charm effect that a save can end, you can make a saving throw against the effect at the start of your turn.
