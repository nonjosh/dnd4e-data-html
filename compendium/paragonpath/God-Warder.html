		<h1 class="player">God Warder</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Training in Religion<br/><br/>The gods decreed that the primordials would trouble the planes no more. To make good on this proclamation, they directed their servants to maintain prisons and preserve chains to ensure that these beings never escaped. You have made this cause your own and pledged your implement or weapon to the holy purpose of containing the primordials forever.<br/><br/><h3>GOD WARDER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Exacting Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, choose one creature within 5 squares of you that you can see. You can pull that creature up to 5 squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Heaven’s Chains (11th level)</b>: Immobilized enemies grant combat advantage to you. In addition, when you hit an enemy with a melee or ranged daily attack power and deal damage to it, you can reduce that damage by 10 (and no less than 10) to immobilize the target until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bind the Wicked (16th level)</b>: Whenever you hit an immobilized enemy with a melee or ranged attack, you can cause the enemy to be restrained instead of immobilized.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">God Warder Attack 11</span>Righteous Prohibition</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The creature before you quavers at the brilliance of your strike and finds itself unable to respond in kind.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier vs. Will.
