		<h1 class="player">Sigil Carver</h1><p><i>&quot;By carving sigils of strength and power into the air, I support my allies and foretell the doom of my foes.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage, aegis of shielding class feature<br/><br/>Bereg-arnadh is the ancient eladrin art of drawing calligraphy with a blade. Bodyguards of the legendary eladrin queen Suiradrun were the first to use bereg-arnadh, and the practice has since become more widespread. Practitioners of this arcane tradition inscribe magical, glowing characters of Rellanic script into the air with their blades. These hovering runes are charged with arcane power from the calligrapher. The sigils hover for a short time, emitting a lambent radiance that evokes protection for allies or enmity toward foes.<br/>Your mastery of the flying sword makes you an ideal practitioner of bereg-arnadh. Whether you studied texts to learn the art yourself, or you earned the right to study under a master of bereg-arnadh, you have gained the ability to wield the arcane art on the battlefield. On the tip of your blade, you sculpt runes, the mere sight of which strikes fear into your adversaries.<br/><br/><h3>SIGIL CARVER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bolstering Sigil (11th level)</b>: Any allies adjacent to you gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Energizing Sigil (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally within 5 squares of you can roll a saving throw against each effect on him or her that a save can end.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Punishing Sigil (16th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy marked by you within 5 squares of you hits an ally who is adjacent to you, you can make a melee basic attack against that enemy as an opportunity action.
