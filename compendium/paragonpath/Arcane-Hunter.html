		<h1 class="player">Arcane Hunter</h1><p><i>&quot;Every creature is vulnerable to my blade, for any resistance can be overcome.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage, aegis of ensnarement class feature<br/><br/>You are adroit at spotting chinks in your enemies’ defenses and taking advantage of those weaknesses to inflict debilitating blows. Your arcane senses give you the upper hand when you face creatures that rely on natural resistances.<br/>As an arcane hunter, you might have been trained at an early age to visually recognize the physical weaknesses of creatures. Since then, your magical education has further refined those skills, allowing you to extend tendrils of unseen energy to feel out a foe’s flaws.<br/>In your studies and adventures, you have learned that adaptability is one of the best qualities when facing a variety of foes. Instead of specializing in one damage type or one type of attack, you prefer to have options.<br/><br/><h3>ARCANE HUNTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Knowing Strike (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, that attack ignores all resistances and the insubstantial quality.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Perfect Strike (11th level)</b>: Whenever you score a critical hit, your attack deals extra damage equal to the target’s highest vulnerability.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Exploitive Eye (16th level)</b>: Whenever you attack a creature that has one or more resistances, you treat those resistances as 10 lower than they are (minimum 0).<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Arcane Hunter Attack 11</span>Exploit Weakness</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your arcane insight guides you to an enemy’s weakness, letting you exploit that vulnerability.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Intelligence modifier damage.
