		<h1 class="player">Giantslayer</h1><p><i>&quot;Don’t like being hit in the shins? Then bring your face down here!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter or ranger<br/><br/>When the deities first called upon their mortal followers to take up arms against the primordials, the first giantslayers were among the heroes who joined the angelic legions. Not all who fought giants were deemed slayers, but a tough corps of warriors faced giants successfully time and again, thus earning the moniker their descendants use with pride to this day. They developed a battle style that proved effective against creatures larger than human size, as numerous monstrous beings are.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giantslayer is, then, an intrepid warrior prepared to face enormous foes. Although plenty of other martial paths have more mundane applications, only the gutsy and the venturesome bother to train as giantslayers. Skill in a broad range of weaponry makes taking out big foes easier. Ranged attacks can hit the eyes or other hard-to-reach areas; melee weapons can be used to take out the legs, cutting a gigantic creature down to manageable size. Such a warrior is ever resourceful.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giantslayer must also acknowledge that gruesome death is a possible end to his or her vocation. This fact, combined with the sheer audacity required for the job, means that most giantslayers are larger-than-life figures. Those who claim the title of giantslayer have a reputation for fighting hard and playing hard. Those who share the calling respect each other. Legitimate slayers police the ranks for charlatans, following up on rumors of fake giantslayers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to being a giantslayer, you are the genuine article. Maybe you learned the trade from a mentor. Although some military organizations incorporate such techniques, no formalized tradition of giant slaying exists. The lessons learned on your past adventures might have been all the instruction you need. Fast, tough, and courageous, you know what it takes to cut down big opponents—even if that means going for a ride on one.<br/><br/><h3>GIANTSLAYER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Giant-Slaying Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and AC until the start of your next turn.
