		<h1 class="player">Anarchic Adept</h1><p><i>&quot;I see the order within uncertainty; I touch the chaos within law. I stand in both worlds as master of order and disorder.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent<br/><br/>As your psionic talent matures, you find yourself focusing on the disparate nature of the disciplines you master. Focusing your thought on the edge of unpredictability in your training, you discover the latent chaos flowing through your magic. Through trial and error, you learned to master the chaos latent within your powers and unleash it against your enemies. Drawing on the power of chaos can be dangerous, but you are up to any risk you might face.<br/><br/><h3>ANARCHIC ADEPT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Anarchic Surge (11th level)</b>: When you use ardent surge, roll a d6. If you roll an even number, the target of ardent surge can also teleport 2 squares as a free action. If you roll an odd number, add the die result to the hit points the target regains.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chaotic Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can choose to bestow the power of chaos onto one ally adjacent to you or adjacent to any target of the attack. Roll a d6 to determine the effect.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>d6</th><th>Chaotic Action Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>No effect.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The ally shifts as a free action.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The ally gains a +1 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The ally gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The ally gains a bonus to damage rolls on his or her next attack equal to your Charisma modifier.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The ally can make a basic attack as a free action.</td></tr></table><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Clarity in Confusion (16th level)</b>: You do not grant combat advantage for being dazed or stunned.

That creature is removed from play. At the start of your next turn, it reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 squares of you that isnâ€™t hindering terrain. In addition, the target is subjected to a chaos distortion (save ends). Until the distortion ends, when the target ends its turn within 5 squares of you, you can teleport it 5 squares to another square within 5 squares of you as a free action.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/210940000" target="_new">Psionic Power</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
