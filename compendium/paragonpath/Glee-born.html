When a dragonborn becomes known for excessive jesting or practical jokes, he or she is shunned and called glee-born or “touched by copper.” Rather than accept scorn, glee-born embrace their fun-loving nature and welcome the title with pride, even if they are forced into exile away from dragonborn lands. Luckily, many human kings welcome glee-born into their courts as jesters or courtesans.<br/><br/>Glee-born are quick to laugh, but they can be dangerous in battle. A sly word or cutting insult can easily distract a foe, and glee-born are known to have arcane talents that they use liberally in combat.<br/><br/>Only true copper dragons could match the sly wit of a glee-born, and many scholars posit that the gleeborn must have coppers in their lineage. Indeed, the scales of older glee-born have been known to develop an orange hue and even a green verdigris tinge late in life.
