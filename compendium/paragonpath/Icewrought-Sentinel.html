		<h1 class="player">Icewrought Sentinel</h1><p><i>&quot;Submit, or feel the wrath of the season of death!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>Nature sleeps when winter falls, resting until the warmth of spring creeps across the land once more. Though forests grow quiet and few creatures stir, the warden’s duty endures when the land is at its most vulnerable.<br/><br/>An icewrought sentinel harnesses winter’s power for the world’s defense. Whether you are drawn to this path through a natural affinity for wintry wastes or a spiritual connection to the season of darkness, your first step on the path to becoming an icewrought sentinel brings about changes in your body. Your flesh feels cool to the touch. Your eyes become a deep blue but turn frost-white when you are angry, and your lips and extremities take on a faint blue cast. When you use your warden evocations, snow swirls in the air around you as lines of frost form and quickly vanish on your skin.<br/><br/><h3>ICEWROUGHT SENTINEL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cold Snap Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, each enemy that is adjacent to you or marked by you takes cold damage equal to one-half your level. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with cold powers until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Frigid Embrace (11th level)</b>: You gain cold resistance equal to 5 + one-half your level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Winter's Winds (16th level)</b>: When you hit an enemy with a primal cold power, you slide that enemy 2 squares after the attack is resolved.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Icewrought Sentinel Attack 11</span>Rime Shackles</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your weapon strikes with bitter cold that freezes the target in its tracks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Cold</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier cold damage, and the target is immobilized until the end of your next turn.
