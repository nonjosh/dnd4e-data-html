		<h1 class="player">Soul of Erosion</h1><p><i>&quot;I am of that which digs and dissolves. I tear away and destroy, and you are next.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, causticsoul elemental manifestation, watersoul elemental manifestation<br/><br/>The soul of erosion combines the two most insinuating elements: water and its destructive cousin acid. Those who pursue this path perfect a devastating fighting style that sweeps foes aside even as it sears them.<br/><br/>Some genasi who follow this path consider the union of water with its Abyssal analogue a measured balance of the natural and the unnatural. Others think of it as diluting their corruption with purity, and cruel minds consider it tainting the purity of the watersoul with the bile of the Abyss. All you know is that, whatever anyone else thinks, your abilities get the job done.<br/><br/><h3>SOUL OF EROSION  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Erosion Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can shift half your speed before or after the action. Each enemy adjacent to you at any point during that move takes 5 acid damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Union of Blessed and Cursed Waters (11th level)</b>: You manifest both watersoul and causticsoul at the same time when you manifest either one. This feature allows you to use both swiftcurrent and acid surge in the same encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flowing Movement (16th level)</b>: You are insubstantial while you are moving.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Soul of Erosion Attack 11</span>Acid Whirlpool</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Tainted water flies out from you to strike a foe before you draw it, and your foe, back in to you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Acid</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength or Intelligence + 6 vs. Fortitude<br/>Level 21: Strength or Intelligence + 9 vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d8 + Strength or Intelligence modifier acid damage, and you pull the target 2 squares.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Soul of Erosion Utility 12</span>Causticsoul Skin</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your body dissolves into water and acid and clings to your enemy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Acid</b><br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 1 square into the target’s space and occupy the same space as the target. While you occupy the target’s space, the target takes ongoing 10 acid damage (save ends), you cannot attack the target, and if the target moves, you move with it. You take half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and the target takes the same amount and type of damage (the target ignores this part of the effect). This effect ends when the target succeeds on its saving throw or if you move or are forced to move out of the target’s space. If the effect ends while you are in the target’s space, you shift to an unoccupied space adjacent to the target.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Soul of Erosion Attack 20</span>Corrosive Torrent</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You create a rushing flow of fluid that makes the eyes water and burns the flesh.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Acid</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength or Intelligence + 9 vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d6 + Strength modifier or Intelligence modifier acid damage.
