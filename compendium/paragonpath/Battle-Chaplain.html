		<h1 class="player">Battle Chaplain</h1><p><i>&quot;Fear not, friends, for we do the work of the gods.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric<br/><br/>When evil bubbles up from the Abyss and spills into the world, when insane hordes raid and plunder civilized lands, or when lawlessness threatens society, you fight back to preserve the world. You shoulder this burden willingly, but you can lighten the load by uniting your companions behind your holy mission. You lead through your inspiring presence, wise words, and brave deeds, with the goal of one day ushering your allies to the glory that awaits bold champions of your faith.<br/><br/>You are a soldier of your god, but not a proselytizer. All deities and their servants have a place in the world. Your role is to unite disparate beliefs and achieve a common victory. Your tolerance, however, does not extend to those agents of ruin who would subvert your harmonious message with their ambition and greed.<br/><br/>When you sing hymns and recite scripture in battle, a silver halo appears above your head as a symbol of your belief and divine blessing. Its light fills your comrades with hope and purpose, helping them to rise above the mundane and seize their destinies.<br/><br/><h3>BATTLE CHAPLAIN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battle Chant (11th level)</b>: Whenever an ally hits an enemy that is adjacent to you, you can mark that enemy.
