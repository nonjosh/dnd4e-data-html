		<h1 class="player">Battle Engineer</h1><p><i>&quot;A workshop? Not for me. I’ll be on the front lines.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Artificer<br/><br/>During the Last War, most artificers provided logistical and technological support. A few artificers refused to stay in workshops, though. These artificers were battle engineers, and they carried their skills into battle. Battle engineers proved a vital addition to the armies of the Last War. Today, those who follow in the battle engineers’ tradition are also formidable fighting companions.<br/><br/><h3>BATTLE ENGINEER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Aggressive Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and your weapon attacks deal 1d6 extra damage until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Brutal Enchantment (11th level)</b>: Whenever one of your artificer or battle engineer powers grants an ally a bonus to weapon damage rolls, that ally’s weapon also becomes brutal 1 until the bonus ends.
