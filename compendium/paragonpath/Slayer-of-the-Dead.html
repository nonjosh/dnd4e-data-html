		<h1 class="player">Slayer of the Dead</h1><p><i>&quot;Stay in your graves, hungry dead! Or when I am done with you there will be nothing left to rebury.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin<br/><br/>The undead that crawl out of the earth and shamble from chill barrows are an unnatural blight upon the land. You have taken up the charge of destroying these horrors with the brilliant light of your faith. The undead are no longer the people they once were, and sending them back to their graves is the only way to respect those whose corpses walk again in undeath.<br/><br/>You were appointed to your holy task after undergoing sacred rituals and learning ancient prayers that invest you with the power to eradicate the walking dead. This paragon path is well suited to followers of Pelor, god of the sun and enemy of the creatures of darkness. Paladins of Ioun too are dedicated to foiling the plans of Vecna, who is the god of undeath as well as the keeper of foul secrets. However, many deities encourage their followers to dispatch the undead as violations of divine law, so slayer traditions are strong among the devotees of many gods.<br/><br/><h3>SLAYER OF THE DEAD  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Incandescent Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, that attack deals extra radiant damage equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier against the first target hit by it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scorn the Dead (11th level)</b>: You gain resist necrotic equal to 5 + your Strength modifier.
