		<h1 class="player">Desert's Voice</h1><p><i>&quot;There are voices in the land. I can hear their cries in the wind and in the shifting dunes. They call to me, begging for vengeance. Have I any choice but to answer?&quot; </i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi<br/><br/>Your purpose has become clear. You see it in the desolation around you, in the ruins scattered across the countryside, in every agonized face you behold. The wind carries it with the stench of carrion, smoke, and fire. The ashes left by defilers, the bone fields that mark the places where tribes, cities or entire races were wiped out—these signs have revealed to you your reason for being: to repair the world. Perhaps the pull you feel is in your head, a delusion born from desperation. Do you dare ignore it? If the despoilers aren’t stopped, what future does this world have? So you take upon yourself a dread task to undo the damage done to this world.<br/><br/><h3>DESERT'S VOICE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Athasian Totem (11th level)</b>: You gain proficiency with the totem as an implement.
