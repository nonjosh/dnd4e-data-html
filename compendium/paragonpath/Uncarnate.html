		<h1 class="player">Uncarnate</h1><p><i>This shell of skin, organs, and bones is only a vessel—one I yearn to leave behind to be free of the limitations of matter.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psion<br/><br/>An uncarnate’s ultimate goal is to become a being of pure mind, unbound by the limits of corporeality. “The flesh is weak, but the mind is strong” is an aphorism among many psions, but uncarnates take it as their guiding truth. They seek to become discarnate, to grow into creatures of pure thought held together by psionic will.<br/><br/>Uncarnates don’t seek the paths of undeath that some arcanists choose. Though uncarnates using their abilities are sometimes mistaken for wraithlike spirits, such spirits are bound by the chill chains of undeath, not the self-generated will of psionic might.<br/><br/>You set yourself possibly the greatest psionic challenge: to maintain the clarity and power of your mind as you slowly work at forgetting the flesh that supports it. In the end, it’s only the mind that matters.<br/><br/><h3>UNCARNATE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flicker into Nothing (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to attack with a psionic power, you become insubstantial until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Misty Step (11th level)</b>: Your psionic attacks ignore the insubstantial quality.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Discarnate Form (16th level)</b>: When you spend at least 4 power points to augment a psionic power, you become insubstantial until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Uncarnate Attack 11</span>Phantom Hook</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You let fly a psychic harpoon, which disrupts both flesh and incorporeal matter with equal reliability.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Augmentable</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and you pull the target 1 square.
