		<h1 class="player">Battle Captain</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord<br/><br/>You become the epitome of the combat leader in action, an inspiring battle captain who easily flows from issuing commands to engaging the enemy and back again as conditions on the battlefield warrant. As a leader who fights as well as he leads, you have earned the loyalty and respect of your allies, and together you have been forged into a cohesive combat team.<br/><br/><h3>BATTLE CAPTAIN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battle Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. To gain this bonus an ally has to see and hear you when you spend the action point.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cry Havoc (11th level)</b>: On the first round of combat (or both the first round and the surprise round if your allies act during the surprise round), any ally who starts his or her turn within 10 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battle Inspiration (16th level)</b>: When you heal an ally with your inspiring word, the ally gains a +1 power bonus to attack rolls and speed until the end of your next turn. If you have the Tactical Presence class feature, the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battle Captain Attack 11</span>Force Retreat</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You hurl yourself into your adversary, knocking him back into his allies and causing them all to stumble away from you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] damage, and you push the target a number of squares up to your Intelligence modifier.
