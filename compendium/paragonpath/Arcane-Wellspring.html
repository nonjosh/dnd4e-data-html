		<h1 class="player">Arcane Wellspring</h1><p><i>&quot;I don’t care why it works. I just know it does.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer<br/><br/>Arcane power flows in all sorcerers, an innate part of them. For you, however, that power is like a geyser building up beneath the earth before it finally erupts with devastating and glorious force. Your connection to that power has always been easy, almost instinctual. It’s so much a part of you that it slowly transforms you, making you into a being as much of the forces you channel as of flesh and soul.<br/>As you walk the path of the arcane wellspring, you master a second damage type. You learn spells that channel both damage types or that surround you with swirling arcane energy. Ultimately, you gain the ability to transform yourself into arcane energy for a brief time.<br/><br/><h3>ARCANE WELLSPRING  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Double Resistance (11th level)</b>: If you have Dragon Magic, choose a second damage type for your Dragon Soul class feature. If you have Wild Magic, roll twice on the Wild Soul table after each extended rest. (If you get the same result a second time, roll again.) Whichever of these two Spell Source options you have, you gain resistance to both damage types, and your arcane powers ignore any target’s resistance to both types up to the value of your resistance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Split Spell Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to target an additional creature when you use an arcane power that normally targets only one, instead of taking an extra action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Antagonistic Transposition (16th level)</b>: When you use an arcane power that is an area or a close attack, you can teleport two creatures hit by the attack, swapping their positions before resolving the attack.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Arcane Wellspring Attack 11</span>Twin Bolt</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Summoning internal reserves, you hurl a bolt of magic that reflects the two forces that infuse you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b> ; <b>Varies</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d10 + Charisma modifier damage.

If you do so, you can make two attacks with this power, each against a different target. Each target the attack hits takes 3d12 + your Charisma modifier damage, instead of 3d10 + your Charisma modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Arcane Wellspring Utility 12</span>Sorcerous Wings</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Arcane power surrounds you and spreads out behind you to form wings.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b> ; <b>Varies</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a fly speed of 6, and you can hover, and whenever an enemy makes an opportunity attack against you, that enemy takes 2d10 + your Charisma modifier damage.

In addition, when any creature makes a melee attack against you or when you first enter a creature’s space on your turn, the creature takes 3d6 + your Charisma modifier damage. The damage is the two types you resist with your Dragon Soul or Wild Soul class feature and with your Double Resistance path feature.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 148.</p>
