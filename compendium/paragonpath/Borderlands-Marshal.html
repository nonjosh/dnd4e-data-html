		<h1 class="player">Borderlands Marshal</h1><p><i>&quot;I find the weak spot in the enemy's defenses; you exploit it.&quot; </i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, Warrior of the Wild multiclass feat. <br/><br/>Path Features: Ranger Affiliation, Grim Satisfaction, Reinforce the Weak, Borderlands Ethos. <br/><br/>Survival in the bloody frontier lands follows a savage code without the niceties of honorable engagement. Your experiences in the world’s darker conflicts have pushed you to a pragmatism that other warriors may lack—react fast, or die. If you can strike first, you will. If you miss, you aim your blows to push your enemies into your allies’ blades. And when your allies find a way to strike your enemies by surprise, you anticipate and aid their actions. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might say that your methods are haphazard and desperate. They may be right, but as far as you can tell, desperate efforts are exactly what’s required. <br/><br/><h3>BORDERLANDS MARSHAL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grim Satisfaction (11th level)</b>: Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against your quarry.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reinforcing Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each ally who can see and hear you gains a +4 bonus to his or her lowest defense until the start of your next turn. If multiple defenses are tied for lowest, the ally chooses which one gains the bonus.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Open Quarry (16th level)</b>: When you or an ally uses the Hunter’s Quarry class feature, you or the ally can designate any enemy you can see as the quarry (rather than the nearest enemy).<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Borderlands Marshal Attack 11</span>Tag Quarry</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attack shows all who the hunted is.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee or Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a heavy thrown weapon to use this power at range.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier, and you can designate the target as your quarry as if you had used the Hunter’s Quarry class feature.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Borderlands Marshal Utility 12</span>Pack Hunter Stance</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You fight your chosen foe with a rhythm that shows your comrades how to form up during the assault.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, whenever you hit your quarry, you or one ally within 5 squares of you can shift as a free action.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Borderlands Marshal Attack 20</span>New Victim</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You brutally choose a new quarry by making a swift attack.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee or Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your quarry is reduced to 0 hit points</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a heavy thrown weapon to use this power at range.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Strength modifier.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You can designate the target as your quarry as if you had used the Hunter’s Quarry class feature.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217897200" target="_new">Martial Power</a>, page(s) 119.</p>
