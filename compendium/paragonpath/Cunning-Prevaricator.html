		<h1 class="player">Cunning Prevaricator</h1><p><i>&quot;There is a saying among the fey creatures who trip between worlds: Only through dishonesty is honor earned.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Bard<br/><br/>Fey tricksters, gnomes, and storytellers of every race know many legends unfamiliar to other creatures—tales from secluded forests, burrows deep underground, the lairs of powerful beasts, and the locked vaults of powerful monarchs. And what they don’t know, they make up.<br/>As a cunning prevaricator, you traffic in the honored (at least among some) traditions of exaggeration, misdirection, and out-and-out lying. You study and follow the teachings of great fabulists of the past—all of them fictional, almost certainly—and apply that knowledge to your bardic skills. You transfer your natural talent for illusion and deception to your friends, granting them some small measure of glory—or so you try to convince them.<br/><br/><h3>CUNNING PREVARICATOR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shrouding Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and one ally you choose within 5 squares of you become invisible until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Virtue of Deceit (11th level)</b>: When you use your Bardic Virtue class feature, one ally you choose within 5 squares of you gains combat advantage against the target of his or her next attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trickster's Mercy (16th level)</b>: When you use majestic word to heal a bloodied ally, that ally becomes invisible until the start of his or her next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Cunning Prevaricator Attack 11</span>Lying Lights</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your allies strike the chosen foe, they vanish in clouds of glittering light.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d8 + Charisma modifier radiant damage.
