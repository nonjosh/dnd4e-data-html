		<h1 class="player">Kulkor Arms Master</h1><p><i>&quot;Swords are pretty, there’s no doubt of it. But if you want to crack open plate armor or split a dragon’s scales, you’ll need a weapon with more hitting power.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, Kulkor Battlearm Student feat<br/><br/>You are a well-traveled veteran, a pragmatic mercenary who has fought in a dozen different lands. Along the way, you’ve come to appreciate the virtues and drawbacks of various weapons. Sometimes you’re a soldier, sometimes a bodyguard, and sometimes a freebooter in search of the next opportunity. Wherever you go and whatever you do, though, you’re always a master of arms.<br/><br/>Many who share your combat style are heartless sellswords, fighting only for the next bag of gold. You might be motivated by coin, or you could find yourself drawn to a higher cause. Perhaps you pursue a calling as a wandering trainer, instructing castle guards and village militias in the effective use of their weapons. You might be a footloose traveler, searching for a worthy place or cause to serve with your martial skills. Or you might be a renowned troubleshooter, awaiting the next chance to test your skills against violent brigands or fierce marauders. You’re willing to slay monsters and dangerous beasts if that’s what needs to be done, but your true calling is to face enemies that have steel in their hands and prove your mastery over them.<br/><br/><h3>KULKOR ARMS MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Kulkor Master (11th level)</b>: If you use an axe, a hammer, or a mace that has the versatile property to hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, that enemy grants combat advantage to all creatures until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Kulkor Persistence (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to attack with an axe, a hammer, or a mace that has the versatile property, and that attack misses every target, you can reroll one attack roll but must use the second result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Smite the Fallen (16th level)</b>: Once per round, when you knock an enemy prone with a melee attack, you can deal damage to the target equal to half your level as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Kulkor Arms Master Attack 11</span>Arms Master Challenge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You lash out at foes within reach, and then call out another enemy a short distance away.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Make a secondary attack.</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Target</b>: One creature other than the primary target</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Choose one enemy within 5 squares of you other than the primary target or the secondary target.
