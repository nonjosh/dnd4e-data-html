		<h1 class="player">Beastblooded Minotaur</h1><p><i>&quot;Beast? Me? You haven’t seen anything yet!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur<br/><br/>The fury of Baphomet is at the root of your people’s creation. His demonic rage is still connected to you and yours, giving strength. In your line of work, the allure of increased might is a temptation too great to resist. You learned to tap hatred and wrath to lay your enemies low. Fury is your friend when steel rings, and the cries of the wounded and dying fill the air. The grim majesty of combat quickens your minotaur soul. What began as your hesitant step in the direction of savagery has become a full run toward your inner beast. You refuse to pay homage to Baphomet, but you don’t turn away from his gifts. Why should you, when you can use the demon lord’s own weapons against him? Still, the desire to kill sometimes threatens to overwhelm you. Your body ripples with power, and you become more beastly as time passes. Should you question the wisdom of your decision?<br/><br/><h3>BEASTBLOODED MINOTAUR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Beastly Action (11th level)</b>: Immediately after you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can charge as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bloodied Outburst (11th level)</b>: Whenever you are first bloodied in an encounter, you can make a melee basic attack against an adjacent enemy as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Savage Apotheosis (16th level)</b>: Your speed increases by 2 and your reach increases by 1.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Beastblooded Minotaur Attack 11</span>Sweeping Gore</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You catch your foe on your horns and toss it out of the way,</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must charge and use this power in place of a melee basic attack.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength + 6 vs. AC<br/>Increase to Strength + 8 at 21st level.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Strength modifier damage, and the target slides 2 squares.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Beastblooded Minotaur Utility 12</span>Thrashing Horns</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You swing your horns in a deadly arc, catching those who are off their guard.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Whenever you hit an enemy with an opportunity attack, you deal an additional 1d6 damage and push the target 1 square.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Beastblooded Minotaur Attack 20</span>Giant's Sweep</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With a vicious sweep of your weapon, you drive your foes down before you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, the target is pushed 2 squares and knocked prone.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and the target is pushed 2 squares, but is not knocked prone.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/369" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 369</a>, page(s) 10.</p>
