		<h1 class="player">Gatekeeper</h1><p><i>Though the Living Gate from which you descend is destroyed, you retain a knack for guarding thresholds.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shardmind<br/><br/>The Living Gate, the first best defense against the horror of the Far Realm, is gone, dissolved into thousands of disparate crystal shards. A disaster, certainly, but you are keenly aware of the upside; some of those shards make up your body and some quanta of the original animating consciousness of the Living Gate makes up your mind.<br/><br/>Aside from the obvious benefit of your own existence, it should also be clear that you are composed of the physical manifestation of a straightforward concept, which fundamentally is about controlling access through a threshold.<br/><br/>Whether others call a feature a gate, a door, or an entry doesn’t matter; all that matters is that you can conceive of a particular area as a threshold. Once you’ve got that fixed in your mind, your body viscerally responds, granting you ever greater abilities to open or close a way, to monitor a passage, to ward off foes, and to keep your allies safe.<br/><br/><h3>GATEKEEPER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dangerous Threshold (11th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy leaves a square adjacent to you and enters a square that is not adjacent to you, that enemy grants combat advantage until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gatekeeper's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to gain an extra action, until the end of your next turn enemies treat the squares adjacent to you as difficult terrain.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gate Ward (16th level)</b>: When you are first bloodied in an encounter, you regain the use of your chosen threshold utility power. Additionally, any enemy within or adjacent to the wall created by your chosen threshold power grants combat advantage.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Gatekeeper Attack 11</span>You Shall Not Pass</h1><p class="flavor"><i>An enemy trying to pass by you or an ally suddenly lights up in an agony of psionic backlash.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy leaves a square that is adjacent to you or one of your allies</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma + 6 vs. Fortitude<br/>Level 21: +9.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d12 + Intelligence modifier, Wisdom modifier, or Charisma modifier psychic damage, and you pull the target 3 squares and it is immobilized (save ends).</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Gatekeeper Utility 12</span>Chosen Threshold</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You declare a threshold of your choice off-limits to interlopers, and you can defend it even when drawn far away.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> wall 4 within 10 squares</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The area of the wall becomes your chosen threshold that lasts until the end of your next turn.
