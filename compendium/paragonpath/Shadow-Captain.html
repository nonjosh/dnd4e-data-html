		<h1 class="player">Shadow Captain</h1><p><i>&quot;My soldiers do not tire, thirst, or anger. If you cross me, your soul will join their ranks.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord<br/><br/>Not all heroic warriors walk in the light. As a shadow captain, you know there is strength to be found in darkness. Among the lost souls, you gain the power to command shadows. Spirits carry out your wishes on the battlefield, and those forces are strong and disciplined.<br/><br/><h3>SHADOW CAPTAIN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow Captain's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and an ally within 5 squares of you deal 1d6 extra necrotic damage on melee attacks until the end of your next turn. Increase this damage to 2d6 at 21st level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow's Reconnoitering (11th level)</b>: Shadowy spirits constantly whisper to you, describing the unseen. You gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks and a +2 bonus to Insight checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inspiring the Invisible Legion (16th level)</b>: When you score a critical hit, the target of the attack is harried by shadows, causing the creature to grant combat advantage to any attacker until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Shadow Captain Attack 11</span>Underworld Gambit</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Shadows writhe around your weapon, infusing your attack with necrotic energy that deprives your enemy of strength.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Necrotic</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Primary Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage.

Until the end of the encounter, each time you hit the target, a new shadow is created and the old one is destroyed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow is a reflection of the target. It has the defenses, immunities, resistances, speed, and melee basic attacks of the target. The shadow also has the same type and keywords, though it has the shadow origin. The shadow has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages the shadow. You control the shadow as a free action, which acts on your turn and has one standard action.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 146.</p>
