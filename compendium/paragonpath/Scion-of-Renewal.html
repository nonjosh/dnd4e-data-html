		<h1 class="player">Scion of Renewal</h1><p><i>&quot;We are bathed in the spirits of the great river. Nothing you do can bring us harm.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power<br/><br/>One of most ancient of shamanistic practices focuses on the river of renewal, an ancient, all-encompassing flow of spiritual energy that protects living things and allows them to heal. Tribal elders invoke the river of renewal to cleanse plagues, grow crops destroyed by pestilence, and help close the wounds of war. No sickness exists that this powerful energy cannot cure. Many shamans who strive to end suffering and bring healing to their people seek to be bathed in the spirits of the river.<br/><br/>As a scion of renewal, you invoke spirits from the river to cleanse your allies. Through your power, the body’s natural healing is accelerated, making it able to better fight off diseases and effects of a natural and magical nature. You can call on the spirits of the river to strike at your foes, leaving behind an aura of healing for your allies. Your spirit companion becomes a fount of spiritual energy from the river of renewal, taking on a watery appearance as it provides a neverending supply of pure energy to bolster those around it.<br/><br/><h3>SCION OF RENEWAL  PATH FEATURES</h3>“We are bathed in the spirits of the great river.
