		<h1 class="player">Faithful Shield</h1><p><i>&quot;Behind me, friends! They shall not touch you.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin<br/><br/>You are a living bulwark, protecting the defenseless. You are the shelter in the storm. As a faithful shield, you place your companions’ well-being above your own.<br/><br/>Faithful shields are supreme examples of devout warriors, found in most of the world’s faiths. Such warriors safeguard holy sites and divine servants. Others set out into the world to lend their talents to those who need it most, whether the folk of a frontier town surrounded by enemies or a band of adventurers working to thwart a dire threat.<br/><br/>Rather than focusing on dealing damage, you give your companions the time they need to win through. You might partner with another defender, forming an impregnable wall, or work with a trusted striker, blocking enemy attacks and creating openings for your ally. When your group is hard pressed, you might cover the retreat, slowly giving ground while your friends flee to safety.<br/><br/><h3>FAITHFUL SHIELD  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sheltering Hands (11th level)</b>: Whenever you use your lay on hands power, the power’s target gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the start of his or her next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shielding Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and each ally within 5 squares of you also gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex until the start of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Defensive Presence (16th level)</b>: When any ally within 5 squares of you takes the second wind or the total defense action, any enemy that hits that ally before the end of his or her next turn takes radiant damage equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Faithful Shield Attack 11</span>Protecting Smite</h1><p class="flavor"><i>A decisive strike against your enemy gives your allies a chance to see to their own defense.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Charisma modifier damage, and each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Faithful Shield Utility 12</span>Constant Shield</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You channel divine might through your shield to defend yourself and your charges.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be using a shield.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, you and any allies adjacent to you gain a +2 power bonus to AC and Reflex.
