		<h1 class="player">Fear Walker</h1><p><i>&quot;You have a reason to be afraid.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, dragonfear racial power<br/><br/>The ability to affect others with supernatural draconic fear changes the way a dragonborn sees the world. Dragonborn are already proud, and seeing other creatures flinch and cringe before him or her only swells that pride. Pleased by others’ reactions, they learn how to focus the dragonfear they wield. They hone it into a weapon and force enemies to their knees, tears streaming from their faces in terror. It is an exhilarating feeling that the best fear walkers learn to control.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mastery of others’ fear is still growing, but it is already formidable. When you choose, you make enemies grovel at your feet, and you’ve found few you cannot make fear for their lives with choice words and a threatening stance. Soon, you will achieve the same skill with this ability that the dragons themselves wield.<br/><br/><h3>FEAR WALKER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fear Mastery (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with fear powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fear Walker's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, one creature you can see cannot attack you until the end of your next turn or until you attack it.
