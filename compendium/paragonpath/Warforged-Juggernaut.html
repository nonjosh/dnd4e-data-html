		<h1 class="player">Warforged Juggernaut</h1><p><i>&quot;Out my way, flesh bags!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warforged<br/><br/>You have dedicated yourself to physical perfection—to becoming an embodiment of strength and prowess. Perhaps you were on the front lines in an army of the Last War, or maybe you were created in the waning days of that conflict and yearn to explore your military nature. Whatever the case, you relish the act of rushing headlong into your enemies and driving them before you. As a warforged juggernaut, you are an unstoppable force, most at home on the battle field surrounded by dozens of foes. When you choose to hold a position, you keep it. Your training and build have given you the ability to shake off attacks that would devastate your allies.<br/><br/><h3>WARFORGED JUGGERNAUT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Charging Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make a charge attack, you gain a +2 bonus to speed and to all defenses until the end of your next turn.
