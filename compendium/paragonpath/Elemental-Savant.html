		<h1 class="player">Elemental Savant</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer (elementalist)<br/><br/>You have grown confident in your ability to shape your chosen element to your will. Winds shift and swirl at your least gesture, and flames brighten and dance in your presence, eager to answer your call.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having mastered the talent of manipulating your element in the world around you, you now seek to understand its secret essence and bind it to yourself.<br/><br/><h3>ELEMENTAL SAVANT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Elementalist Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, the next sorcerer attack power you use before the end of your next turn deals extra damage to one target of the attack. The extra damage equals one-half your level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Savant Focus (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls with powers granted by your Elemental Specialty class feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Savant Power (11th level)</b>: You gain an additional sorcerer at-will attack power of your choice.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Confer Protection (16th level)</b>: While they are adjacent to you, allies share the resistances you gain from your Elemental Specialty class feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Elemental Nature (20th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against ongoing damage and dazing or stunning effects. You also gain an additional use of elemental form each day, but you can use the power only once per encounter.<br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Elemental Savant Utility 12</span>Elemental Form</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With a thought, you force open your connection to the primordial forces.
