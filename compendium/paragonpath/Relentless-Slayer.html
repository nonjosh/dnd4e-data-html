		<h1 class="player">Relentless Slayer</h1><p><i>&quot;I am the bane of your kind.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger, oath of enmity power<br/><br/>Many avengers find themselves confronting some great threat, such as a group of drow seeking to enslave a surface kingdom, an incursion of demons, a cult of Tharizdun worshipers, or an empire of vampires secretly ruling over human cities. Whatever the threat might be, it is dire enough to drive you to an old and powerful rite of sacred commitment. Through prayerful vigils, you have invested your oath of enmity with tremendous potency. All avengers rely on oath of enmity, but you draw on yours to perform exceptional feats in battle.<br/><br/>As a relentless slayer, you are always alert for signs that your enemies are at work. Your adventures often lead you away from a longtime adversary for weeks or months at a time, but you know that you have a sacred duty to which you must eventually return.<br/><br/><h3>RELENTLESS SLAYER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lethal Action (11th level)</b>: If you spend an action point to make an attack against your oath of enmity target, the attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Slayer's Oath (11th level)</b>: Whenever you use oath of enmity, you can target a second enemy with it if that enemy is your slayer’s enemy (see the sidebar). In addition, when you make an attack and could make two attack rolls because of oath of enmity, you can choose to forgo making the second roll to cause the attack to deal 2d6 extra damage instead. You make this choice before making the first attack roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Relentless Determination (16th level)</b>: When you fail a saving throw against an effect caused by an enemy, your divine attack powers deal 5 extra damage until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Relentless Slayer Attack 11</span>Slayer’s Gambit</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You recklessly bull your way through the press of enemies to meet your destiny near your chosen foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You move your speed to a square where your oath of enmity target is within your reach.
