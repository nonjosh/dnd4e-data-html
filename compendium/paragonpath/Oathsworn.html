		<h1 class="player">Oathsworn</h1><p><i>&quot;Your words are nothing but wind. My words endure.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger, oath of enmity power<br/><br/>For certain avenger sects, the swearing of oaths is a central part of their religious observances and their rites of initiation. In the teachings of these sects, an oath sworn by an avenger is akin to the words of creation spoken by the gods to give lasting form to the world; when the avenger’s will and the god’s will are one, an avenger’s oath has the power to make reality conform to the words of the oath.<br/>As a member of one of these oathsworn sects, your oath of enmity power carries particular weight. When you swear your god’s judgment against a foe, that creature’s attacks are less likely to harm you. When your foe lies dead, you claim the reward of fulfilling your oath, drawing new vigor for the remaining battle. As you advance along the oathsworn path, you gain powers that are more effective against the target of your oath, weakening it or making it vulnerable to your later attacks. You can even grant the benefit of your oath of enmity to your allies for a short time, ensuring that they help you bring your foe to justice.<br/><br/><h3>OATHSWORN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blood Oath (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses against attacks made by your oath of enmity target.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sworn Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you make two attack rolls against each target of that attack and use either result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Enduring Oath (16th level)</b>: When your oath of enmity target drops to 0 hit points, you can spend a healing surge as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Oathsworn Attack 11</span>Oath of Weakness</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you strike your sworn foe, the power of your oath saps its strength and will.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Your oath of enmity target</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage, and the target is weakened until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Oathsworn Utility 12</span>Sworn Crusade</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The holy nimbus representing your oath against an enemy surrounds your allies too, endowing them with deadly accuracy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, each target makes two attack rolls and uses the result he or she prefers when making a melee attack against your oath of enmity target.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Oathsworn Attack 20</span>Oath Bond</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You bind a foe with your oath, consigning it to your god’s punishment.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Your oath of enmity target</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: The target gains vulnerable 5 to your attacks (save ends).</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 45.</p>
