		<h1 class="player">Earth Shaker</h1><p><i>&quot;My strength is the strength of the earth. There is no shame in your falling, but you would be foolish to attempt to rise.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>Regardless of the combat tricks you have learned during your adventuring career and the tactics with which you have surprised your enemies, a part of you yearns for direct and uncomplicated applications of might. The path of the earth shaker appeals to you because it matches strength to strength—your mastery of weapons augmented by the power of the earth beneath your feet, working together to oppose the raw might of dragons and behemoths, demons and deities.<br/><br/>The strength of earth that you draw on allows you to move through the ground at speed, even as your attacks bypass an opponent’s armor to strike at the body within. Your connection to the natural world allows you to seek out targets behind obstacles or even within the ground, and your attacks can knock your foes down.<br/><br/>Leave the subtleties of strategy and complex tactics to others. Instead, you keep faith with the oldest spirits of rock and earth, letting their grim determination guide you in your mission to defend the world from forces that would despoil it.<br/><br/><h3>EARTH SHAKER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Full Impact (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against Fortitude.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Surging Earth (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action while you are in guardian form, each enemy you hit with a primal attack power before the end of your next turn is knocked prone.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Certain Gravity (16th level)</b>: Your at-will warden attacks can target Fortitude instead of AC.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Earth Shaker Attack 11</span>Shake the Earth</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attack emits a pulse of thunder that strikes around obstacles and can wrench burrowing creatures from the ground.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 4</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Special</b>: Solid obstacles do not block line of effect for the burst.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier thunder damage.
