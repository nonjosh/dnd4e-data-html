		<h1 class="player">Soul Binder</h1><p><i>Death is not always the end. Not until the fight is over.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane, divine, or shadow class; must worship Nerull<br/><br/>For those who devote themselves to Nerull, the nature of the Reaper becomes clear. These few can access a shard of Pluton—a domain of the restless dead unclaimed by the Raven Queen—and bend it to their will. For a true worshiper of Nerull, few higher rewards exist.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a soul binder, you have bound a soul to your service. The soul might be that of an enemy whose torment you wish to prolong, a loved one whose company you wish to keep, or a friend whom you’re saving from a vile afterlife. Regardless of your reasons, the soul must protect and serve you.<br/><br/><h3>SOUL BINDER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Call Bound Soul (11th level)</b>: You gain the call bound soul power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Soul-Bound Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, your bound soul can also take a standard action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Touch of Pluton (11th level)</b>: You can choose for your attacks that deal necrotic damage to also deal radiant damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Overflowing Soul (12th level)</b>: You gain the overflowing soul power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Death Is the Source (16th level)</b>: Whenever your attack or that of your bound soul drops a nonminion enemy below 1 hit point, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + one-half your level. As a free action when you gain the temporary hit points, you can transfer some or all of these hit points to your bound soul.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gray Legionnaires (20th level)</b>: Gain the gray legionnaires power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Soul Binder Attack 11</span>Call Bound Soul</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call the soul bound to serve you into the physical realm.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Summoning</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You summon your bound soul into an unoccupied space within range.
