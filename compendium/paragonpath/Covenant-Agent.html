		<h1 class="player">Covenant Agent</h1><p><i>&quot;You never know when the hand of a god will intercede directly in your life—or death.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Assassin, avenger, either the oath of enmity or assassin’s shroud power<br/><br/>Covenant agents are elite killers who are trained to deal precision strikes against enemies of their god with little to no detection. As a loyal member of your chosen deity, you have already learned skills that make you a prime candidate for taking on the mantle of covenant agent. How you got to this point varies and is based on your religion’s structure (or lack thereof ), and what goals you accomplish in the name of your god can also vary greatly from any other covenant agent’s goals.<br/><br/>You already know how to kill. It’s not a question of skill in that area, nor does anyone question your commitment to kill when needed. Now, however, you are fully invested in being a weapon used by your chosen deity. You spend countless hours honing your skills in stealth, subterfuge, and unconventional stratagem, plus you must tend to your normal commitments to your religious patron and maintain whatever façade you have chosen. Your path is one of secrecy—none outside your religious organization should learn of your ties to it. This can place pressures on you that those with whom you travel do not understand. As far as they know, you are what you choose to present to them, whether that’s a light-hearted adventurer seeking treasure or a stoic combat veteran who just happens to know a few extremely effective ways to deal with those seeking your blood.<br/><br/><h3>COVENANT AGENT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bleeding Defeat Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, if that attack hits and deals damage, the target also takes ongoing 10 radiant and necrotic damage (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shadow of the Gods (11th level)</b>: Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage or radiant damage to an enemy with an assassin attack, an avenger attack, or a covenant agent attack, the target of the damage also takes a -3 penalty to the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Harbinger (16th level)</b>: Any creature that has one of your shrouds on it or is your oath of enmity target loses necrotic resistance and radiant resistance.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Covenant Agent Attack 11</span>Withering Onslaught</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your deft speed and skill allow you to debilitate your enemy with deadly precision.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Necrotic</b>, <b>Radiant</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One enemy</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Dexterity modifier necrotic and radiant damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You can choose to either place your oath of enmity effect on the target (in addition to any other creature that is already on the target of your oath of enmity) or subject the target to one additional shroud (as per your assassin’s shroud power).</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Covenant Agent Utility 12</span>Precision Gait</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You skillfully stride across terrain, allowing very little to hinder your precise movement.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You shift a number of squares equal to your speed and enter the prevision gait stance.
