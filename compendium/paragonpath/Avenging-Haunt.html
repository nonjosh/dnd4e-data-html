		<h1 class="player">Avenging Haunt</h1><p><i>Death couldn’t stop me. Do you really think you can?</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Revenant<br/><br/>Death frees souls from the concerns of life, but some wrongs the departed remember—even if the mind has long rotted away. You’re the ghost of a life you barely recall; yet, you can’t forget what they did. And you won’t forgive it either. Some power put you back in this world, and whether or not it did so for this reason, you’re out for revenge. Of course, those who wronged you in the past aren’t the only ones on your hit list. You received a second chance, and this time you’re not letting anything slide.<br/>With each enemy you bury, you feel a little hollower. The cold rage gives way to a numbing chill, and life—your previous one and the half-life you now lead—slips quietly away into oblivion. Still, what difference does it make? You’re already dead.<br/><br/><h3>AVENGING HAUNT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ghostly Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, you gain phasing and insubstantial until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Death Reprisal (12th level)</b>: When an enemy’s attack reduces you to 0 or fewer hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unkillable (16th level)</b>: Your Unnatural Vitality racial feature allows you to stay conscious until you die.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Avenging Haunt Attack 11</span>Deathly Retort</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your soul lashes out with necrotic energy at one who would harm you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Necrotic</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 20</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: A creature within 20 squares of you hits you with an attack.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Your highest ability modifier + 4 vs. Fortitude<br/>Level 21: Your highest ability modifier + 6 vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: The target takes necrotic damage equal to the damage you took from the attack.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Avenging Haunt Utility 12</span>Haunting Form</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You adopt a ghostly form to achieve your vengeful aims.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You gain insubstantial, phasing, and fly 6 (hover, maximum altitude 2 squares) until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Standard</b>: If you don’t sustain this power, you can land as a free action.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Avenging Haunt Attack 20</span>Death Locus</h1><p class="flavor"><i>After an initial burst of black, life-sapping energy, your body is flooded with a killing darkness that is attracted to those it initially touched.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Necrotic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 1 within 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Your highest ability modifier + 6 vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 5d8 + your highest ability modifier necrotic damage, and if the target attacks you, it takes half the damage it deals you as necrotic damage (save ends).</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and if the target attacks you before the end of your next turn, the target takes half the damage it deals you as necrotic damage.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/376" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 376</a>, page(s) 43.</p>
