Pray tell, how did you manage it?&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Trained in Bluff and Diplomacy<br/><br/>Almost every scoundrel relies on their wit and their words to some extent, but you have refined them to a cutting edge. Your mouth is a sharper weapon than your sword, and you rely on it at least as much.<br/><br/>You might be a con artist, looking to earn your way in the world at the expense of others. You could be a diplomat, a spy, or a master of disguise. Or perhaps you developed these skills accidentally, discovering as you adventured that you preferred wars of wits to battles of blades.<br/><br/><h3>SILVER-TONGUED SCOUNDREL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Deceptive Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain combat advantage against one enemy you can see until the end of your next turn. In addition, you score a critical hit against this enemy on a natural roll of 18–20 until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fast-Talker (11th level)</b>: The first time you succeed on a Bluff or Diplomacy check in each encounter, one ally you can see gains a +5 power bonus to his or her next Bluff or Diplomacy check before the end of the encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Deceptive Challenge (16th level)</b>: You can roll a Bluff check or Diplomacy check in place of your standard initiative check.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Silver-Tongued Scoundrel Attack 11</span>Diverting Taunt</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your bewildering and enraging taunts distract your target from far more devastating attacks to come.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target grants combat advantage for this attack.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + highest ability modifier damage, and the target grants combat advantage and cannot make opportunity attacks until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Silver-Tongued Scoundrel Utility 12</span>Master Negotiator</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Through careful study of body language, intonations, and other subtle clues, you can tailor your own efforts to your adversary.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Choose Bluff or Diplomacy.
