		<h1 class="player">Bloodfury Hunter</h1><p><i>&quot;Angry? I’ll show you angry!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shifter, ranger<br/><br/>Every ranger needs to tap into the beast inside; this task is especially simple for a shifter like you. You have honed your senses. You can smell blood in the air and hear the sound of your foe’s racing heartbeat; at times, you can even taste the fear you inspire. By embracing the animal inside you, you become a true hunter.<br/><br/>Some shifters suppress their animal instincts, but you crave the adrenaline rush that comes over you when you unleash your inner beast. Your muscles are charged and your senses are enhanced. It’s at these times that you feel alive and you are most dangerous to your enemies.<br/><br/>You gain resilience through unleashing the beast inside you. You have spent extensive time alone in the wild, where beasts were your only companions. You have studied them, watched the way they move and fight. Like them, when you become injured, you’re even deadlier. You gain speed, strength, and ferocity. Your opponents would do well to eliminate you quickly; otherwise, they’ll find that you’re at your best when you’re in the last throes of life.<br/><br/><h3>BLOODFURY HUNTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dynamic Transformation (11th level)</b>: Whenever you use your longtooth shifting or razorclaw shifting racial power, you can shift 2 squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shifter's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your attacks deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier until the end of your turn.
