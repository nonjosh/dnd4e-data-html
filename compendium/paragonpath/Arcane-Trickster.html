		<h1 class="player">Arcane Trickster</h1><p><i>&quot;My tricks come from tool and spell.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue, trained in Arcana<br/><br/>You’ve never been content to stick to one path. Magic and larceny, spell and trap, dweomer and shadow—for you, all came easy. You learned to fuse your knowledge into one style, both in and out of battle.<br/><br/>When you were a child, you dreamed of grand achievements. You enjoyed the shows of illusionists and magicians, and you reveled in the skill of pickpockets and burglars. You followed two divergent paths that eventually came together in your mind as a way of life and a cohesive style of attack. You don’t separate the martial from the magical, and you are mildly scornful of anyone who is so shortsighted as to make this division.<br/><br/>You never sought a position in an arcane order or a thieves’ guild; you didn’t want to limit yourself. Instead, you learned to recognize that each adventure is an opportunity to test your mettle, sharpen your skills, enhance your magic, and discover treasures.<br/><br/>Eladrin are naturals for this path because of their agility and keen intellect. Arcane tricksters are found among gnomes, changelings, and drow as well. Some use their knowledge and power for adventure, and others use it for theft, torture, and deception.<br/><br/><h3>ARCANE TRICKSTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcane Burglary (11th level)</b>: You can use a dagger as an implement.
