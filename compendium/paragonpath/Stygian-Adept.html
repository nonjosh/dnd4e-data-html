		<h1 class="player">Stygian Adept</h1><p><i>&quot;There are no fears but those of your own making.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent<br/><br/>There are shadows in the mind. Unnerving memories, old fears, and crushing disappointments all lie ready to be exploited and manipulated. Those who know these fears can turn them into weapons, amplified until they unravel the consciousness. You are familiar with these fears, and you wield them like razors.<br/><br/>As a stygian adept, you sense the fear and terror in your enemies, harnessing these emotions and using them to attack your foes’ minds. With your powers you can create phantom terrors that only your opponent can perceive, distracting the enemy from your allies as they move into position. A foe firmly in your grasp finds itself lost in a maze of half-realized imaginings, each more terrible than the last.<br/><br/><h3>STYGIAN ADEPT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fleeing Fear (11th level)</b>: Whenever you hit an enemy with a fear power, you can slide the enemy 1 square.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unraveling Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make a fear attack, each target hit by the attack has vulnerability to all damage until the end of your next turn. The vulnerability equals your Constitution modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fearsome Zone (16th level)</b>: Enemies in any zone created by your psionic powers take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Enemies that are immune to fear ignore this penalty.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Stygian Adept Attack 11</span>Stygian Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>To your enemy, you take on the appearance of its greatest fear, causing it to stumble back in terror.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Augmentable</b>, <b>Fear</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Charisma modifier psychic damage, and you push the target a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier.</p><b>Augment 2</b><br/><p class="powerstat"><b>Hit</b>: As above, and you or one ally can make a melee basic attack against the target as an opportunity action at any point during the push.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Stygian Adept Utility 12</span>Haunting Shadows</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Doubts blur your enemies’ vision, making it hard for your foes to see the true threat before them.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn.
