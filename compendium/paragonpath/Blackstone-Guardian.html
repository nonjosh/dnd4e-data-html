		<h1 class="player">Blackstone Guardian</h1><p><i>&quot;I have peered into the darkness clouding my soul, and it has found me worthy.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind<br/><br/>Strange dreams are common among those who wield psionics. Your dreams, however, are different. You dream of a black monolith set within a cavern rimed with ice. This vision has haunted you for as long as you can remember, but until now, you have struggled in vain to discover its meaning.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackstone monolith has chosen you as its champion. In another age, noble champions of a distant land fought to contain a breach to the Far Realm. They sealed the rift with powerful psionic wards, behind elemental stone imbued with their own consciousness. Each generation, the wards they forged must be resealed by new champions. You are bound to the fate of the guardians you follow.<br/><br/><h3>BLACKSTONE GUARDIAN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blackstone Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to use an attack power, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Monolithic Vision (11th level)</b>: Whenever you use your mind spike power, you also slide the target of that power 3 squares.

This augmentation is in addition to the effects that an at-will power might have; this augmentation doesn’t supersede them.</p><b>Augment 2</b><br/><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You gain resistance to all damage equal to your Constitution modifier until the end of your next turn. In addition, one creature you hit with the at-will power is restrained until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/210940000" target="_new">Psionic Power</a>, page(s) 49.</p>
