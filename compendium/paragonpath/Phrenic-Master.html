		<h1 class="player">Phrenic Master</h1><p><i>&quot;Kneel before my intellect and tremble.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Call spirit companion power<br/><br/>Your mind is the gateway through which you imprint your will upon the world. In your studies, you have searched for more powerful ways of asserting that will. By choosing the mind flayer as your totem creature, you’ve gained some of the illithid’s natural prowess at bending the wills of lesser beings.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This connection has taught you hidden secrets of mental dominion, and you’ve found that they can also be applied to the shamanic practice of summoning spirit companions. In order to bind your new spirit companion to your will, you had to prove your dominance over it. Your spirit companion was cowed, to the point that it is more slave than friend. Even so, you know that if you let your guard down for a moment, the slave will try to become the master.<br/><br/><h3>PHRENIC MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Enervating Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, any enemy hit with the attack takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against any effects the attack imposes. Enemies hit by the attack grant combat advantage until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spiteful Retaliation (11th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy attacks your spirit companion and causes it to disappear, that enemy is dazed until the end of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Twin-Souled Projection (16th level)</b>: You can choose to use your spirit companion’s square as the origin square for any of your ranged or area powers. If your spirit companion is not adjacent to any enemies, using a power in this manner does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Phrenic Master Attack 11</span>Intellect Pummel</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attack may not be as potent as an illithid’s mind blast, but you’re satisfied to see your foes stumble about at your whim.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Charm</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d6 + Wisdom modifier psychic damage, and the target is dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You slide each target 2 squares.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Special</b>: You can use your spirit companion’s square as the origin for this attack.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Phrenic Master Utility 12</span>Minion's Shield</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As the attack speeds towards you, you decide that your spirit companion should take the blow instead.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Spirit</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You take damage from an attack while your spirit companion is adjacent to you.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Your spirit companion takes the damage instead of you.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Phrenic Master Attack 20</span>Total Subjugation</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your spirit companion engulfs your enemy completely, controlling its movement as you control its mind.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Charm</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Spirit</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> spirit 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: The target is dominated (save ends).</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: The target is dazed (save ends).</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: If your spirit companion is adjacent to the target at the start of its turn, you can slide the target up to 4 squares and slide your spirit companion up to 4 squares to a square adjacent to the target.
