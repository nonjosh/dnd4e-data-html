		<h1 class="player">Scion of Sacrifice</h1><p><i>&quot;Your threats are meaningless to me. Nothing you say can save you from death at my hands.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin, ardent vow power<br/><br/>The core of your values and the code you follow are rooted in your willingness to give your life for a greater purpose. Your body and soul are strong, and you do not shrink from giving up some of that strength to help others. You strike out with divine fury that racks you with pain but imbues you with even greater strength. You measure your worth by the foes you defeat.<br/><br/>As a scion of sacrifice, you are zealous in the extreme, eager to meet the enemies of your faith regardless of the circumstances. When others pause and deliberate, you act—for better or for worse. However, you are not suicidal. If you encounter a foe clearly beyond your ability to defeat, you retreat to work toward the day when your power matches the enemy’s. Or you might turn aside to aid companions who are in danger, or withdraw to carry the injured away from battle. But in most fights you are grim and fearless. Whether you fall in the effort to defeat a mighty foe or survive to face a new threat tomorrow lies in the hands of your god.<br/><br/><h3>SCION OF SACRIFICE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Devastating Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, the attack deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
