		<h1 class="player">Arcane Battlemaster</h1><p><i>&quot;In battle, as in alchemy, it’s the combination of elements that matters.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, trained in Arcana<br/><br/>Since you first took up arms, you have felt a kinship with wizards, because, like them, you’re at your best when your natural talents are honed by careful study. While young wizards were studying the elements and energy of the multiverse, you were studying tactics, especially the strategies that employ magic as a weapon of war. The presence of a powerful mage changes the entire dynamic of a typical battle, and you have worked long and hard to familiarize yourself with exactly how such a weapon can be employed or defended against.<br/><br/>As part of your study of war magic, you have mastered a small amount of magic yourself. However, you realize your full potential when you’re leading dedicated spellcasters and putting their powers to good use.<br/><br/><h3>ARCANE BATTLEMASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Elemental Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack that hits, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
