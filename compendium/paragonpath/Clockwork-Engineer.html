		<h1 class="player">Clockwork Engineer</h1><p><i>&quot;I make my friends. Letâ€™s call it a hobby.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Artificer<br/><br/>The Last War saw incredible advances in artifice. With the creation of the warforged and the perfection of war machines, artificers attained a deeper understanding of how to blend technology with magic. Although most artificers train in the creation of magical servants, clockwork engineers elevate the practice to an art form.<br/>As a clockwork engineer, you are a master of creating imitations of life from inanimate objects. You can piece together automatons in a few moments. The devices you create are more durable, longerlasting, and more deadly than those created by your artificer peers.<br/>You fashion minions and artifices to aid your companions, although you probably feel as much kinship to the automatons as you feel toward your fellow adventurers. You might dote on your creations, lamenting when they become damaged, and even avenging their destruction.<br/>Outside of combat, harmless clockwork creations surround you. They twitter and buzz, fluttering near you, keeping you company. Many are also helpers, and through their adroit appendages, you can construct other minions more quickly.<br/><br/><h3>CLOCKWORK ENGINEER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Clockwork Coordinated Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain two minor actions, which you can use only to command your summoned creatures.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Durable Artifice (11th level)</b>: Creatures you summon with artificer or clockwork engineer powers have a +2 power bonus to all defenses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Superior Minions (16th level)</b>: Creatures you summon with artificer or clockwork engineer powers have a +2 bonus to speed and a +1 bonus to attack rolls.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Clockwork Engineer Attack 11</span>Clockwork Soldiers</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Scores of tiny metal soldiers drop off your body and swarm a foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 2 within 10 squares</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of miniature clockwork soldiers.
