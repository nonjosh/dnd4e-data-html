		<h1 class="player">Heavenly Deceiver</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Deva<br/><br/>At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness—because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you.<br/><br/><h3>HEAVENLY DECEIVER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Deceitful Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you make an attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Illusion-Sheathed Strike (11th level)</b>: You gain the illusion-sheathed strike power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Snake-Tongued Mastery (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks, and you gain the deceitful image power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Duplicate Image (12th level)</b>: You gain the duplicate image power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Deceitful Terrain (16th level)</b>: When you start your turn, you can use a free action to slide an adjacent enemy to another non-hindering square adjacent to you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Illusion of Solitude (20th level)</b>: You gain the illusion of solitude power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Heavenly Deceiver Feature </span>Deceitful Image</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The image looks real, smells real, sounds real, and feels real to a light touch. But it’s not real.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Illusion</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You create an illusion of any size within the burst that lasts until the end of the encounter, for 5 minutes, or until you use this power again. It appears real to all senses. If the subject of the illusion would normally emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM’s judgment)—it’s not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can give the illusion simple instructions such as moving in a set pattern, appearing to chew on local plants, and similar actions. You can also match actions to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked, for example. The illusion cannot travel outside the area of the burst.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You make a Bluff check when the deceitful image is created. Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks opposed by that Bluff check to detect that they are viewing an illusion. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is fake.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Heavenly Deceiver Attack 11</span>Illusion-Sheathed Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your foes hold you in such fear that it forces them to their knees.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You hit a target with an at-will attack.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: That target of the at-will attack</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1d10 extra psychic damage, and you slide the target up to 3 squares.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Heavenly Deceiver Utility 12</span>Duplicate Image</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Suddenly, there are two of you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Illusion</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, you gain a +5 power bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks and a +2 power bonus to all defenses against other attacks.
