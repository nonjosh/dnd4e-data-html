		<h1 class="player">Demonslayer</h1><p><i>&quot;Run back to the Abyss and tell them I’m coming. Let them prepare their defenses and raise their armies. I look forward to obliterating them all!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin<br/><br/>Embodiments of chaos and cruelty, demons are an affront to your faith, and you seek to destroy them at every opportunity. You have received special blessings and learned battle prayers that are anathema to the denizens of the Abyss. Your attacks pierce their unholy defenses, and simply being near you causes them pain. You won’t rest until every demon is dead.<br/><br/>All but the darkest and most vile of gods regard demons as a blight upon the cosmos and urge their followers to root out demonic threats wherever they appear. Most well-organized faiths support orders devoted to confronting demons; some anoint demonslayers from among the ranks of the faithful using ancient rituals.<br/><br/><h3>DEMONSLAYER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demonslayer's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, the attack deals extra damage equal to one-half your level and ignores resistances.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demonslayer's Presence (11th level)</b>: Any demon that starts its turn adjacent to you takes damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. While any demon is adjacent to you, it can’t shift.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suppress Resistance (16th level)</b>: When you hit a creature that has variable resistance with a melee attack, you negate the resistance until the end of the creature’s next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Demonslayer Attack 11</span>Demonslayer’s Smite</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You intone a prayer over your weapon, empowering it to overwhelm demonic defenses.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC.
