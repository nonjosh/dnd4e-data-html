		<h1 class="player">Half-Elf Emissary</h1><p><i>&quot;There is strength in numbers, and I have many friends who trust me and are willing to fight for me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-elf, bard<br/><br/>You hate to be tied to any one location for too long; you’d rather be on the road, meeting new creatures and seeing new lands and nations. As a result, you feel at home nearly anywhere. This same ability also puts you in the good graces of people you meet along the way.<br/>Your inborn empathy and acquired diplomatic skill allow you to fit into nearly any society—if not as someone who has always lived there, then at least as a trusted friend. By understanding many kinds of people and creatures, you learn how to protect them—or fight them, if need be.<br/>When things turn rough, you can use your knowledge of other creatures to your advantage in a fight. The more foes that try to stop you, the better you can tangle their swords and spells, confounding their attempts to hurt you.<br/><br/><h3>HALF-ELF EMISSARY  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Skilled Speech (11th level)</b>: Your bonus to Diplomacy checks from your Group Diplomacy racial trait equals your Charisma modifier. In addition, allies within 10 squares of you apply this bonus to all checks with Charisma-based skills in which you are trained.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Valorous Action (Half-Elf Emissary) (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, allies you can see gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. In addition, you regain the use of the encounter power you gained from your Dilettante racial feature if you have used it during this encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Heal the Besieged (16th level)</b>: Whenever you use a bard healing power on an ally, increase the number of hit points regained by 1d6 for each enemy that is adjacent to that ally.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Half-Elf Emissary Attack 11</span>Emissary's Onslaught</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your weapon clashes against your foe, a thunderclap resounds and empowers all your nearby allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Thunder</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Charisma modifier thunder damage.
