		<h1 class="player">Phantasmagoric Scoundrel</h1><p><i>&quot;Look behind you. No, really . . .&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Trained in Arcana, trained in Bluff or Thievery<br/><br/>For some scoundrels, the ability to convince and deceive by using language is insufficient. They want to fool the eyes, not just the ears; they want to find far more reliable means of tricking those who would stand against them.<br/><br/>Some of these, such as you, choose to dabble in magic. Either through training or innate talent, you have mastered the art of illusion, and you combine that with your own wits and rapier-sharp tongue to build a repertoire of perfect deception.<br/><br/><h3>PHANTASMAGORIC SCOUNDREL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Blinding Action (11th level)</b>: When you use an encounter or daily power to hit a target that grants combat advantage to you, you can spend an action point to blind the target until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Combat Illusionist (11th level)</b>: You gain one arcane illusion encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from any class of your choice. You cannot choose a power you already know. At 21st level, you can replace this power with an arcane illusion encounter attack power of 13th level or lower from any class of your choice.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Expert Phantasmagorist (11th level)</b>: You can master and perform rituals of the deception category as though you had the Ritual Caster feat. In addition, once per day you can perform a deception ritual of your level or lower without spending the component cost (though you must still use any focus required by the ritual).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Illusory Communication (16th level)</b>: Once per encounter before you make a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, you can choose to roll an Arcana check also. You can use the Arcana check in place of the original check.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Master Phantasmagorist (16th level)</b>: One additional time each day, you can perform a deception ritual of your level or lower without spending the component cost (though you must still use any focus required by the ritual).<br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Phantasmagoric Scoundrel Utility 12</span>Corner of the Eye</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Illusory sounds and flickering shadows make empty space appear menacing and dangerous.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 1 within 10</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst becomes a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. Enemies treat the zone as difficult terrain and grant combat advantage to melee and close attacks while within the zone. While the zone lasts, you can perform the following actions:</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Minor Action</b>: Move the zone 1 square.</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Move Action</b>: Move the zone your speed.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Phantasmagoric Scoundrel Attack 20</span>Deadly Visions</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You implant horrifying images in your enemyâ€™s mind and blood, besieging their psyche.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b> ; <b>Implement</b> or <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Make an at-will attack against a single target. If the attack hits, it deals 2d10 extra damage and the target suffers debilitating hallucinations (save ends). Until the target saves, it grants combat advantage and chooses at the start of its turn each round whether to take 10 psychic damage or be dazed until the start of its next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Miss</b>: Half damage, and the target is dazed until the end of its next turn.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/386" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 386</a>, page(s) 17.</p>
