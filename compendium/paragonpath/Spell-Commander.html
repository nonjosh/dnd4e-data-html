		<h1 class="player">Spell Commander</h1><p><i>&quot;Cast your spells where I say, when I say, and how I say and we’ll all live to tell about today’s battle.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Artificer<br/><br/>Spell commanders are artificers who transform their allies into walking weapons of arcane destruction. Typically found as a part of more militaristic arcane institutions, spell commanders learn magic that help them increase their allies’ spell power. Additionally, most spell commanders work as a part of a small squad, and many of the spells they wield are focused around small squad tactics, including rapidly moving across the battlefield.<br/>Most spell commanders receive standard military training, including the foundation of small arms use (particularly bows and crossbows). Spell commanders combine conventional military education with their arcane knowledge to create a more hybridized approach to warfare.<br/>As a spell commander, you know how to combine traditional combat techniques and weapon use with the power of arcane magic. Your focus is on transforming your allies into more accurate, more powerful, and more mobile forces, effectively taking on the role of a squad leader who uses spells to facilitate this transformation.<br/><br/><h3>SPELL COMMANDER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcane Weaponmaster (11th level)</b>: You can use a bow or crossbow as an implement for ranged artificer attack powers.
