		<h1 class="player">Guardian of Two Worlds</h1><p><i>&quot;I protect civilization from nature and nature from civilization.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden<br/><br/>You are the guardian of two worlds. You know the perils of the wild, but you also know the corruption that dwells in the heart of civilization. Many wardens eschew civilization in favor of the purity of nature. Although you see the virtue in their point of view, you have chosen to straddle both realms in the hopes of keeping an eye on each. You know that if either becomes too dominant, neither can flourish. So you live and work, instructing people on how to interact with and be respectful of the forest, but also protecting them from deadly predators and harsh storms.<br/><br/><h3>GUARDIAN OF TWO WORLDS  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Guardian Trick (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to gain an extra action, if you are in guardian form, you can make your guardian form attack with that action even if you have already made that attack this encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tangling Wild (11th level)</b>: While you are in guardian form, any enemy marked by you that starts its turn adjacent to you is slowed until the end of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Warden of Both Worlds (16th level)</b>: On your turn, the first time you hit an enemy marked by you, you can make one saving throw against an effect that a save can end as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Guardian of Two Worlds Attack 11</span>Strike of the Sentinel</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attack forces your enemies to stand their ground and face your threat.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and any enemy adjacent to you and marked by you is immobilized until the end of its next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Guardian of Two Worlds Utility 12</span>Stand of the Protector</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Those who stand near you are revived and refreshed by your stalwart presence.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: At the start of your turn, when you use your Font of Life class feature, a single ally adjacent to you can also make a single saving throw against an effect that a save can end as a free action.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Guardian of Two Worlds Attack 20</span>Form of the Stag Knight</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You become the stag knight, a creature of legend that stalks the borderland to protect those who cannot protect themselves.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You assume the form of the guardian of both worlds until the end of the encounter.
