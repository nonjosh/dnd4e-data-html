		<h1 class="player">Dragonslayer</h1><p><i>&quot;My sword, my shield, and my faith are all I need to confront the most terrifying monsters.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin<br/><br/>A champion must fight many monsters, and the most savage and ferocious of these are dragons. They sport a daunting arsenal of claws, fangs, stings, roars, and breath weapons, and they are protected by iron-hard scales and supernatural vitality. Many also have a wicked, calculating intelligence. Few warriors stand a chance against such foes, but you have made it your duty to protect defenseless folk against their depredations. You seek out all destructive monsters—including other fantastic beasts such as manticores, wyverns, and sphinxes—and put an end to their reigns of terror.<br/><br/>You might be a hunter of some skill, but you do not rely on patient stalking, trap-setting, or sudden ambush to defeat your sworn enemies. You meet monsters openly in chivalrous combat, pitting your skill and courage against fiery breath and flashing fang. It’s a fair fight.<br/><br/><h3>DRAGONSLAYER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dragonslayer's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +2 bonus to all defenses against creatures marked by you.
