		<h1 class="player">Master of the Starry Night</h1><p><i>&quot;The stars are points of light burning beyond the world. Some believe them to be windows though which inimical creatures study our cosmos. In my view, that’s a parochial conception of stars, at best.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock, star pact<br/><br/>You understand the true nature of stars, and your knowledge surpasses that of nearly all other creatures. You have studied all the standard texts of star pact warlocks. You found the interpretations contained within those tomes to be catastrophic if accepted as fact. Perhaps some stars are windows into the Far Realm, as many star pact warlocks claim. You suspect that many stars hold other secrets, though. Thus, you have forged a new set of beliefs.<br/>With your star charts, astrolabe, and viewing glass, you have determined the luminosity and motion of many stars. You have plumbed their colors, their sizes, and most important, the power they offer to a warlock. You understand the symbiosis of nature and magic that is embodied by the stars, and so you have twisted your pact into something different from those of your counterparts. You no longer fear the depths of the sky, for you are the master of the starry night.<br/><br/><h3>MASTER OF THE STARRY NIGHT  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Star-Blessed Wanderer (11th level)</b>: If you use the bonus from your Fate of the Void pact boon on an attack roll and you miss with the attack, you retain the bonus until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Starcrossed Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, one creature cursed by you is dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fate of the Body (16th level)</b>: As a free action during your turn, you can expend your Fate of the Void bonus to gain an equivalent bonus to speed or to one defense until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Master of the Starry Night Attack 11</span>Stellar Debris</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Brilliant stellar debris explodes outward from you, burning your enemies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Fire</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Constitution or Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d8 + Constitution modifier or Charisma modifier radiant and fire damage.
