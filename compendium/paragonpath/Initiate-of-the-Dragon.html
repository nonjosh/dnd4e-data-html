		<h1 class="player">Initiate of the Dragon</h1><p><i>&quot;The dragon holds many secrets, and with those secrets, I battle the forces of darkness.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Monk<br/><br/>The monastery you trained at followed a rare discipline, the school of the dragon’s wisdom. Your masters explained that in the ancient days, the dragons taught the mightiest of mortals how to transcend their physical forms and become as mighty as a dragon. Your monastery teaches that with the right focus and discipline, you too can master the secrets of the dragon.<br/><br/>You learn to focus your psionic power outward, unleashing the dragon’s fiery breath and turning your skin into an armored hide of dragon scales. You move with the dragon’s speed, dancing on the wind with wings of psionic power. Once you master this discipline, you learn how to transform into a dragon for a brief moment.<br/><br/>Half-orc monks are frequently drawn to this paragon path, since their agility and strength serve them well on this path. By the same token, their fiery rage matches the dragon’s anger when it is called to battle.<br/><br/><h3>INITIATE OF THE DRAGON  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dragon's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can use a free action to deal fire damage to each enemy in a close blast 3.
