		<h1 class="player">Half-Giant Thug</h1><p><i>&quot;Oh, did I get in your way? This alley is too narrow for my bulk. I guess you have to go through me to get where you’re headed.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Goliath<br/><br/>In the city-states, some enslaved goliaths work as enforcers, and the other residents know better than to say no when half-giant thugs come looking for goods or money. The physical might of these thugs ensures that they receive better treatment than most slaves do, and sometimes their children are set free (to appease the parent and guarantee loyalty).<br/><br/>Whether you serve as a slave or seek your own livelihood as a mercenary, violence and intimidation are your most useful tools. You get what you want by using your size, your attitude, and your keen knowledge of the back streets and seedy locations of your city-state. Anyone who’s heard of you clears the way for you to pass, and thanks to your stature, they always see you coming.<br/><br/><h3>HALF-GIANT THUG  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gigantic Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, either you can increase your melee reach by 1 for any attack you make with the extra action, or you can regain the use of stone’s endurance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Half-Giant's Retaliation (11th level)</b>: When an enemy hits you while you have resistance to that attack because of your stone’s endurance racial power, that enemy grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Urban Skills (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 racial bonus to Intimidate and Streetwise.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Untouchable Athlete (16th level)</b>: You gain a +5 bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks while jumping 4 or more squares or while climbing.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Half-Giant Thug Attack 11</span>Towering Presence</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You slam a foe to the ground and stand astride it, preventing the enemy from rising until it has dealt with you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength modifier, Constitution modifier, or Dexterity vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Strength modifier, Constitution modifier, or Dexterity modifier damage, and you knock the target prone.
