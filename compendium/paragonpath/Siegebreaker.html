		<h1 class="player">Siegebreaker</h1><p><i>&quot;This? This is bonebreaker. Let me introduce him to you.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, Fighter Weapon Talent class feature<br/><br/>You might have trained at a fighting school or served in a military outfit, but you found all that discipline and all that rigorous training unnecessary. You see no finesse in swinging an axe. You hit someone and they fall. If they don’t fall, you’re doing it wrong—a problem corrected by just hitting them harder next time. Some warriors sneer at you, dismissing your accomplishments as luck, but the veterans know the truth: You are a killing machine. That’s why they call you the siegebreaker. Oh, not because you are good at driving enemies off, but because you are damn good at punching holes through your enemies’ defenses and bringing stalemates to sudden, bloody ends.<br/><br/><h3>SIEGEBREAKER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bonerender (11th level)</b>: Once per round, when you make a melee attack using a two-handed weapon against an enemy granting combat advantage to you, your attack deals extra damage equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Brutal Action (11th level)</b>: When you hit with a melee attack using a two-handed weapon, you can spend an action point to gain a +1[W] bonus to the damage roll. At 21st level, this extra damage increases to +2[W].<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You're Next (16th level)</b>: Every time you reduce a nonminion enemy to 0 hit points, one enemy within 5 squares of you grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Siegebreaker Attack 11</span>Bitter Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>So fierce is your attack that your enemy panics, ignoring your allies for one disastrous moment.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fear</b>, <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a two-handed weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target grants combat advantage to all attackers until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Siegebreaker Utility 12</span>Brutal Momentum</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your attacks fall with such fury that your enemy cannot possibly defend against them all.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, whenever you hit an enemy with an at-will attack power using a two-handed weapon, your next attack against that enemy gains +2 power bonus to the attack roll.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Siegebreaker Attack 20</span>Shattering Blow</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your weapon crashes into the foe, splitting it wide and leaving it gasping as its vitality sprays the air.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Reliable</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a two-handed weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target is dazed and takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends both).</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Special</b>: If the target granted combat advantage to you, it also falls prone.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/379" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 379</a>, page(s) 67.</p>
