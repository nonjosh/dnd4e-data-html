		<h1 class="player">Lone Wolf</h1><p><i>&quot;One by one they fall, until nothing is left standing.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ranger, Hunter’s Quarry class feature<br/><br/>Through subtle manipulation and quick feints, you excel at isolating an opponent from a group. You use tactics like those of a wolf, focusing on your foe and drawing it away from any assistance. For you, combat is an art form. You choose your target with the same care that a sculptor chooses a block of marble.<br/><br/>You relish the point in battle when the plans of your enemies fall apart. In one-on-one combat, you fight on your terms. You are the razor that cuts out the heart of a group, leaving the rest of your foes in disrepair. You’re a master at choosing the terrain you fight in and the opponent you fight against.<br/><br/>Even though you prefer to act on your own, you rely on your friends to confound enemies and split their focus. This strategy gives you the opportunity to move in and employ your skills. While the others in your group are busy engaging foes and helping each other out of danger, you’re busy taking down the choicest foe.<br/><br/><h3>LONE WOLF  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Focused Hunter (11th level)</b>: While you are adjacent to the target of your Hunter’s Quarry and no other creature is adjacent to you, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Overwhelming Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack that hits the target of your Hunter’s Quarry, the quarry is weakened until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Vanquishing Chase (16th level)</b>: Whenever you hit the target of your Hunter’s Quarry, you can push it 1 square and shift 1 square to a square adjacent to it.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Lone Wolf Attack 11</span>Single Combat Assault</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You challenge your foe to combat, riveting its attention on you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, the target is dazed until the end of your next turn, and if the target is within 5 squares of you, you pull it adjacent to you.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Lone Wolf Utility 12</span>Escape the Trap</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You outmaneuver your foes, slipping past their defenses.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be adjacent to two enemies.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 1 square.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Lone Wolf Attack 20</span>Disperse the Horde</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Focusing on your true opponent, you push away the insignificant foes surrounding you and clear a path to your prey.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst you can see</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage.
