		<h1 class="player">Ardent Champion</h1><p><i>&quot;The fires of heaven inflame my soul. I am a sword in the hand of my god. Death means nothing to me!&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger, Censure of Pursuit class feature, oath of enmity power<br/><br/>Most avengers undergo training in secret temples or monasteries to prepare for their service and receive their powers through rites of initiation, but some are endowed with divine power simply through raw devotion to their god. Such avengers dig deep within themselves to find unmatched reserves of faith, making up for their lack of formal training with holy passion. These are ardent champions.<br/><br/>As an ardent champion, you are an outsider, your spirit touched directly by the hand of your deity. You are most likely unlearned in the esoteric lore of your faith, and you have little connection to any hierarchies associated with it. In fact, others who lack your passion might see you as a threat to the established ways. Where cynics and pragmatists see despair or uncertainty, you see only your divine patron’s will, and you set out to accomplish it regardless of obstacles. If you are meant to triumph, you will. If you are not, you are confident that you will soon be shown another way to serve your god.<br/><br/><h3>ARDENT CHAMPION  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ardent Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also make a saving throw or shift a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier before or after the extra action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Holy Ardor (11th level)</b>: Whenever you make two attack rolls because of your oath of enmity and hit the target of your attack, you score a critical hit if both dice have the same roll, except if both rolls are 1.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ardent Fury (16th level)</b>: Once per round when you score a critical hit against your oath of enmity target, you can shift 1 square and make a basic attack against that target as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Champion Attack 11</span>Fanatical Flurry</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You launch a reckless attack against your chosen enemy and all foes nearby, ignoring your own safety.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Your oath of enmity target and each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Wisdom modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You take a –2 penalty to all defenses until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Ardent Champion Utility 12</span>Battle Rapture</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You enter a state of zealous passion, consumed by the power of your faith.
