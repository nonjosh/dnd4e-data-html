		<h1 class="player">Dragon Guardian</h1><p><i>&quot;The dragon’s traits are mine—its breath, its strength, and its ability to withstand harm. With such weapons, who can hope to withstand me?&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer, Dragon Magic class feature<br/><br/>Dragons are your legacy. You embody one of the manifestations of draconic might. The sheer physical power of dragons inspires you. Your foes glimpse these truths when you demonstrate your powers.<br/>You have studied the movements and strategies of dragons as they fight, both when you heard or read about dragons in epic stories and on a few occasions when you were menaced by one. You are drawn to dragons’ lairs or other places where dragons congregate, eager to learn more about the mighty beasts that are your personal idols.<br/><br/><h3>DRAGON GUARDIAN  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dragon Breath Action (Dragon Guardian) (11th level)</b>: Whenever you spend an action point to make a close blast attack, the attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 16–20.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Guardian's Resistance (11th level)</b>: Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Add that damage type to the resistance granted by your Dragon Soul. You can’t choose a damage type that your Dragon Soul already grants you resistance to.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Indomitable Breath (16th level)</b>: When you make an attack roll with a close blast power, you ignore any resistance and immunity that creatures have to the attack.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Dragon Guardian Attack 11</span>Guardian's Breath</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You harm your foes by breathing on them, forcing them to succumb to your power.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the blast</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2d10 + Charisma modifier damage.
