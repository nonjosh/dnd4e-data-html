		<h1 class="player">Fang of Zehir</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Must worship Zehir<br/><br/>In carrying out the orders of Zehir’s high priests without fail, you have conveyed many souls to the dark god’s maw and earned great honor. Now, by replacing a portion of your soul with the darkness he commands, Zehir marks you as a worthy servant and transforms you into one of his blessed fangs. You have fought fiercely for this accolade, and members of the Third Coil accord you the respect you have earned as one of Zehir’s most zealous servants.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fang of Zehir, your overriding concern is feeding as many souls as possible to your god. You are a holy slayer, dispatched on special missions by Zehir and his high priests. As a reward for your faith, Zehir will alter your mind and body to reflect his glory. It is said that the most faithful of the fangs of Zehir eventually shed their warm-blooded forms altogether, becoming living reflections of their divine master.<br/><br/><h3>FANG OF ZEHIR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Envenomed Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to use a weapon attack power, each creature hit by the power also takes ongoing 10 poison damage and is slowed (save ends both).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Serpent's Speed (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>More Souls for Zehir (16th level)</b>: Your attacks ignore poison resistance.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Fang of Zehir Attack 11</span>Surge of Poison</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you whisper a prayer to Zehir, your attack is imbued with a debilitating poison that cripples your foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Poison</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br/><b>No Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Special</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You hit a creature with a melee attack.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The creature takes 2d10 extra poison damage from the attack and grants combat advantage until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Fang of Zehir Utility 12</span>Shadow Serpent Form</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Zehir rewards your growing devotion by granting you the ability to become a living manifestation of his power.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Shadow</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to the form of a shadow serpent or vice versa.
