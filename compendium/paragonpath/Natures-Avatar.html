		<h1 class="player">Nature's Avatar</h1><p><i>&quot;I am every aspect of nature, its power taken shape in me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wilden<br/><br/>Every wilden manifests the changing face of nature. Each day, a wilden chooses to embody one of nature’s aspects.<br/><br/>For you, these aspects are not just transient states. They are reflections of nature’s versatility and power. As you fight for the preservation of the world, you draw deeply from each aspect. You gain an additional benefit from each aspect while you are bloodied. You have learned ways to funnel the power of nature’s aspects into your attacks. Eventually, you master the ability to quickly change your aspect to meet any challenge with the best tools at your command.<br/><br/><h3>NATURE'S AVATAR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Adaptive Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point, you can change your current aspect of nature to a different one as a free action.
