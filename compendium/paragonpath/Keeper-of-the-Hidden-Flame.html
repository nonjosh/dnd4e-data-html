		<h1 class="player">Keeper of the Hidden Flame</h1><p><i>&quot;The Hidden Flame burns within us all. Draw on it for your fury, or I will call it out for your doom.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid<br/><br/>According to druidic legend, the Hidden Flame is a spark of vigor and vitality that exists within every creature. Beasts, especially predatory mammals, are said to live in harmony with the Hidden Flame within them, calling upon it to fuel their hunting fury. When a creature lets the Hidden Flame burn out of control, the result is a mad savagery that is no more in harmony with the natural way of things than the behavior of those civilized folk who act as if no flame burns within them at all.<br/>You are a keeper of the Hidden Flame, able to tap into this wellspring of strength and bestial fury. By calling to the Hidden Flame in a creature, you can spur that creature into a frenzy that leaves no room for strategic or tactical thinking. You draw on the Hidden Flame in yourself and your allies to perfect your predatory instinct, helping you fight with terrible ferocity.<br/><br/><h3>KEEPER OF THE HIDDEN FLAME  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fury of the Hidden Flame (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to ranged, area, and close attack rolls against the enemy nearest to you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Keeper's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also reroll the next attack you make that misses before the end of your turn, and you must use the second roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Leap to the Fray (16th level)</b>: Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you charges, you and each other ally within 5 squares of you can shift 1 square as a free action.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Keeper of the Hidden Flame Attack 11</span>Summon the Beast</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your foe howls with bestial rage, throwing itself into the fight and right into your trap.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Wisdom vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: You pull the target 5 squares and knock it prone.
