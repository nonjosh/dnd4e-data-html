		<h1 class="player">Life-Stealer</h1><p><i>&quot;Enemies are all around us, offering their life energy for me to use against them.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock class, infernal pact<br/><br/>Your pact with infernal powers has given you the ability to steal and utilize the life energy of your enemies. This life energy provides you with a new avenue to power, and you hunger for it as a vampire craves blood.<br/><br/><h3>LIFE-STEALER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Collect Life Spark (11th level)</b>: When a creature under your Warlock’s Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you take a portion of its life energy by collecting a life spark. As a minor action, you can expend this life spark to gain a benefit based on the creature’s origin. At the end of the encounter, any life sparks you have not expended fade away.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aberrant: You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal: You gain resist 5 to all damage until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elemental: You deal an extra 5 damage to the next target you hit with an attack on your current turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fey: A successful attack you make on your current turn also causes your target to become dazed until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural: Regain hit points equal to one-half your level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow: You become invisible until the end of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Infernal Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, if you use your action to make an attack that hits, that hit deals ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sustain Life Spark (16th level)</b>: If you have more life sparks at the end of an encounter than you do healing surges, you regain hit points as if you had spent a healing surge<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Life-Stealer Attack 11</span>Soul Scorch</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As black fire immolates your adversary, you release one of your life sparks.
