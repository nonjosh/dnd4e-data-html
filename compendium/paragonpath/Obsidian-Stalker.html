		<h1 class="player">Obsidian Stalker</h1><p><i>&quot;Walls, guards, and beasts—none of these things can prevent me from reaching my target.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Assassin<br/><br/>You are a hunting phantom, an assassin who excels at using shadow magic to slip past the tightest defenses. Once you have chosen to slay a creature, no barrier can prevent you from reaching it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>This assassin’s tradition traces its origin to the Obsidian Cave assassins’ guild, an ancient dwarven order that specialized in hunting down and killing Underdark monsters. Initiates of the Obsidian Cave were tasked with finding and killing mind flayers, drow priestesses, and others that sought to attack the surface world. With such preventative attacks, the dwarves ensured that their mines remained safe. Since that time, the hunting phantom’s techniques have passed to assassins from different traditions.<br/><br/><h3>OBSIDIAN STALKER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stalker's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain phasing and become insubstantial until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stalker's Form (11th level)</b>: While insubstantial, you gain a +5 bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks.
