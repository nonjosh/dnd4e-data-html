Instead, you have decided to seize as much of the Abyss's power as you can grasp, and will turn this power back on its source, wielding it against the forces of the Abyss.<br/><br/><h3>ENEMY OF THE ABYSS  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Abyssal Blood Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action and you are bloodied, any enemy within 3 squares of you takes ongoing 5 damage (save ends), and you gain regeneration 5 until no enemy has ongoing damage from this feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Steal from the Abyss (11th level)</b>: When you use your corrupt manifestation racial power, you gain a +2 bonus to your next attack roll, and each demon within 10 squares of you takes a –2 penalty to its next attack roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Abyssal Presence (16th level)</b>: You ignore the resistances of demons within 5 squares of you.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Enemy of the Abyss Attack 11</span>Abyssal Rend</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Channeling the Abyss’s evil, your fingertips tear through your foe’s armor and flesh—more so if you can smell its blood.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength or Intelligence + 6 vs. Fortitude<br/>Level 21: Strength or Intelligence + 9 vs. Fortitude</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d10 + Strength or Intelligence modifier damage.
