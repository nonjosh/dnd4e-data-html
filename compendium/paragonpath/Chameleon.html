		<h1 class="player">Chameleon</h1><p><i>&quot;You can’t solve every problem with a hammer . . .&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Changeling<br/><br/>As a changeling, you alter appearances and identities to suit your purpose. As a chameleon, you take versatility to a new level. You absorb the mannerisms and actions of those around you through careful observation. You not only change your appearance, you alter your powers and are able to perform an astonishing range of maneuvers. The more time you spend with a person, the more accurately you can mimic his or her actions and abilities.<br/><br/><h3>CHAMELEON  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Coordinated Action (11th level)</b>: If you have not already spent an action point in the encounter, when an ally spends an action point to take an extra action, you can spend an action point as an immediate reaction. Your action must be taken after your ally has resolved the action from his or her action point.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shifting Skill (11th level)</b>: During an extended rest, choose one skill in which an ally is trained. At the end of the extended rest, you gain training in that skill until the end of your next extended rest. The ally whose skill you choose must be present during the entire extended rest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Power Focus (16th level)</b>: During a short rest, choose one of your allies’ class or paragon path encounter attack powers of 11th level or lower. At the end of the short rest, you can swap the encounter attack power you gained with imitating strike for the chosen attack power. The ally whose power you gain must be present during the entire short rest.<br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Chameleon Attack 11</span>Imitating Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You demonstrate your skills of mimicry as you perfectly imitate your ally’s attack.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must use this power at the end of an extended rest.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next extended rest, you can use an ally’s class or paragon path encounter attack power of 11th level or lower as if it were your paragon path encounter attack power. The ally whose power you gain must be present during the entire extended rest before you use this power. You can use your Charisma for the attack roll and damage roll instead of the ability scores normally associated with that power’s attack rolls and damage rolls. You do not need to meet the normal prerequisites to use the power, but you must meet any of its requirements.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Chameleon Utility 12</span>Perfect Mimicry</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You carefully study your ally’s abilities, imitating even those that aren’t part of his or her attack retinue.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must use this power at the end of an extended rest.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next extended rest, you can use an ally’s class or paragon path utility power of 12th level or lower as if it were your paragon path utility power.
