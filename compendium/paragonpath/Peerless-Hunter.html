You are ready to wander the planes, seeking out threats to the world that lie far beyond the wilderness paths you once followed.<br/><br/><h3>PEERLESS HUNTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hunter's Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can reroll each attack roll you make before the end of your turn, and you must use the second roll each time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Level 11 Improved Disruptive Shot (11th level)</b>: You gain one more use of disruptive shot per encounter, but you can still use it only once per turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Superior Archery (11th level)</b>: You gain the following benefits associated with your Expert Archer powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Aimed Shot: If you miss with aimed shot, the target takes half damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Clever Shot: If you miss with clever shot, you can slide the target 1 square.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Rapid Shot: When you use rapid shot, you don’t take the -2 penalty to the attack rolls.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hunter's Grasping Trap (12th level)</b>: You gain the hunter’s grasping trap power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Threatening Archery (16th level)</b>: If an adjacent enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can make a ranged basic attack against it instead of a melee basic attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Master Hunter (20th level)</b>: You gain combat advantage against enemies within 5 squares of you when you make ranged weapon attacks against them.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Peerless Hunter Utility 12</span>Hunter's Grasping Trap</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You gather wisps of primal magic and form them into a spectral trap, one that lies hidden from your enemies’ view. When a foe stumbles into the trap, a thick vine emerges from the ground to wrap around it.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One square</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target becomes a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter or until an enemy enters it. Without a Perception check (DC 10 + your level + your Wisdom modifier) your enemies notice neither the zone nor your use of this power. When an enemy enters the zone, the enemy’s movement ends, you can slide it up to 4 squares, and it is slowed until the end of its next turn.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 166.</p>
