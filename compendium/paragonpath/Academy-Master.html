		<h1 class="player">Academy Master</h1><p><i>&quot;How am I this good? Easy. I went to school.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane class<br/><br/>You have a diploma from one of the premier arcane academies, but that bit of paper was only a formality. What you took away from your years of education was an unshakable grounding in the arcane fundamentals and a justifiable confidence in your command over these forces. Since then, you’ve mastered the basics of magic and have begun to weave arcane energy like a true artist. You recognize other practitioners who have your level of education by their calm control over magic, as well as the depths of their knowledge and creativity.<br/><br/><h3>ACADEMY MASTER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcane Underpinning (11th level)</b>: You gain a +2 bonus to Arcana checks. When you hit a target with an arcane at-will attack power, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with an arcane attack power you use against that target before the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Educated Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also reroll the next attack roll you make that misses before the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fundamental Mastery (16th level)</b>: When you hit an enemy with an arcane at-will attack power, you deal 3 extra damage of the same type as the at-will power deals. This extra damage increases to 5 at 25th level.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Academy Master Attack 11</span>Learned Boost</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You masterfully channel arcane energy into one of your simplest powers, imbuing it with surprising power.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Reliable</b> ; <b>Implement</b> or <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Use one of your arcane at-will attack powers on the target.
