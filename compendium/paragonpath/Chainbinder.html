		<h1 class="player">Chainbinder</h1><p><i>&quot;I got its arms—it ain’t going nowhere.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, Rending Chains Warmaster feat<br/><br/>You are a master of a hard and pitiless combat style. Speeches about hope and ideals aren’t for you; you inspire your comrades by showing them how you can rip your enemies to shreds. You’re skilled at fighting with weapons that let you hold your foes so your friends can work them over. The spiked chain is your weapon of choice, since it lets you strike from the second rank.<br/><br/>You might have learned your techniques in the fighting pits of a goblin fortress, in the arenas of a decadent city-state, or alongside brigands in lawless lands. You emerged from this crucible as a gang leader, a hard-hearted mercenary, or a skilled gladiator.<br/><br/><h3>CHAINBINDER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Binding Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to make an attack with a flail and that attack hits, you can grab one creature hit by the attack.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hindering Grasp (11th level)</b>: Any creature grabbed by you grants combat advantage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Warlord's Chains (11th level)</b>: Choose one of the following warlord at-will powers that you know: brash assault, intuitive strike, or wolf pack tactics. The chosen power becomes associated with the Rending Chains Student feat, gaining its benefit.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shredding Escape (16th level)</b>: Whenever an enemy shifts and would take damage from your Rending Chains Warmaster feat, you can instead deal ongoing damage to the enemy equal to your Strength modifier (save ends).<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Chainbinder Attack 11</span>Ensnaring Chains</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You whip your weapon around your foe, leaving an opening for your ally to strike.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a flail.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and you grab the target.
