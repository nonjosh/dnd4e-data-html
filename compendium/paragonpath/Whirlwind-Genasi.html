		<h1 class="player">Whirlwind Genasi</h1><p><i>&quot;Only a fool fights against the wind.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, windsoul elemental manifestation<br/><br/>The wind is immortal. Air moves and flows around us all, it is a source of life, and yet it is capable of wreaking terrible destruction. Hurricanes and windstorms can bring a castle down around a king’s ears, or hurl even the greatest hero off a cliff to rocky death below. Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight, the ability to send your foes sprawling with gale-force wind, or the power to sweep the field of battle with a boulder-crushing, tree-splintering tornado are all as commonplace to you as a casual wave of your hand. You control the flow of a fight, using your power over air to move your foes like pawns around a chessboard.<br/><br/><h3>WHIRLWIND GENASI  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Whirlwind Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain the use of the windwalker encounter power one additional time in this encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Whirlwind Breeze (11th level)</b>: When you use the windwalker encounter power, you gain a fly speed of 8 until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Whirlwind Counterforce (16th level)</b>: When you are pulled, pushed, or slid, you can either decrease the distance by 1 square or increase it by 1 square. If you choose to increase it, you decide the last square you move into. If a creature pulls you into a square adjacent to it, you can increase the pull by 1 as long as you end in another square adjacent to it.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Whirlwind Genasi Attack 11</span>Tumbling Gale</h1><p class="flavor"><i>With a mere thought, you direct a surge of punishing wind to assail your foes and drive them back.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 2 within 10 squares</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each creature in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence + 4 vs. Fortitude, Wisdom + 4 vs. Fortitude, or Charisma + 4 vs. Fortitude Increase the bonus on attack rolls to +6 at 21st level.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 5d4 + Intelligence modifier, Wisdom modifier, or Charisma modifier damage, and you push the target 3 squares.</p><br/>Addition (1/21/2009)<br/>Add “within 10 squares” after “Area burst 2” on the Range line.<br/><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Whirlwind Genasi Utility 12</span>Windsoul Zephyr</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You whisper to the wind, and currents of air gently lift you and your allies off the ground.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You and one or two allies in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You fly 8 squares.
