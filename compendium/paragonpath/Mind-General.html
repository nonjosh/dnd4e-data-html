		<h1 class="player">Mind General</h1><p><i>&quot;You should all be proud of your place as our soldiers. To die for our illustrious family is the greatest honor you will ever know.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Noble adept theme<br/><br/>In the interest of protecting the city-states, the sorcerer-kings allow noble families to keep small armies of slave soldiers. Frequently, they use these soldiers to take action against other nobles or to protect their property. A sorcerer-king can, of course, call upon the nobles’ soldiers to fight for his or her interests. And it’s best to follow the sorcerer-king’s commands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of your duties to your family, you were given charge of a legion of slave soldiers. You trained with them, developing your psionic talents so you could command them silently. (Though sometimes shouted commands and threats can intimidate your enemies far better than eerie silence.) The most skilled mind generals can keep up a continuous mental link, sharing sights and combat instincts with all the troops in the legion.<br/><br/><h3>MIND GENERAL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Commanding Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally within 10 squares of you can shift half his or her speed as a free action and also gains a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b>: You gain 2 additional power points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reward Victory (11th level)</b>: When an ally whom you can see within 10 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Telepathic Gestalt (16th level)</b>: You can link minds with your allies, splitting their focus and perceptions as you see fit. At the start of each of your turns, choose two conscious allies within 20 squares of you. (You don’t have to be able to see them.) One of them gains a +2 bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will, and the other takes a -2 penalty to the same defenses.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Mind General Attack 11</span>Direct Order</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You stagger the target with a mental attack, either to provide your ally with a vulnerable target or allow the ally to get away</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: The target is dazed until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: As a free action, one ally adjacent to the target can either take a move action or make a melee basic attack with a +2 power bonus to the attack roll.</p><b>Augment 2</b><br/><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: As a free action, two allies adjacent to the target can each either take a move action or make a melee basic attack with a +2 power bonus to the attack roll.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Mind General Utility 12</span>Legion's Press</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You send out a telepathic command for your allies to get into position.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One ally in the burst, or each ally in the burst if this is your first turn of the encounter</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Each target can shift half his or her speed as a free action.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Mind General Attack 20</span>Unequaled Command</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You extend your psionic influence to everyone nearby, continually shifting the field of battle to perfect its arrangement.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Psychic</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Primary ability vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 4d6 + ability modifier psychic damage, and you slide the target 3 squares.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You can assume the stance of unequaled command.
