		<h1 class="player">Dragon Marshal</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord<br/><br/>Entire schools of study have been devoted to the topic of making war upon dragons and other fearsome beasts of great size, and you have studied them all. Whether leading an adventuring party or an entire army, you are most at home with the swords and spells of allies behind you, and one really big target before you.<br/><br/><h3>DRAGON MARSHAL  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b>: You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Vengeance for All (11th level)</b>: When you take damage from a close or area attack, each ally you can see who was also a target of that attack gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the creature that attacked you until the end of your next turn. If the attacker is a dragon, it is a +2 bonus.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unflagging Spirit (16th level)</b>: When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack and misses, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to your level and can make a saving throw. If the ally’s attack missed a dragon, the ally regains hit points equal to your level instead of gaining temporary hit points.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Dragon Marshal Attack 11</span>Beast-Surrounding Maneuver</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You and an ally skim along the enemy’s flank, stabbing as you go.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Strength modifier damage, and an ally adjacent to the target can make a melee basic attack against the target as a free action.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Shift 1 square and make the secondary attack.

Until you end your turn in a square not adjacent to the target, when the target makes a close attack, you and each ally adjacent to it can make a melee basic attack against the target as an immediate interrupt. If the target is a dragon, it takes a –1 penalty to the triggering attack for each such melee basic attack that hits.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/369" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 369</a>, page(s) 51.</p>
