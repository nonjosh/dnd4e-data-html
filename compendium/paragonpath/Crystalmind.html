		<h1 class="player">Crystalmind</h1><p><i>You are one small part of an entity whose pieces are distributed across all the planes of existence. It’s time to take advantage of that essential once-upon-a-time unity.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shardmind, shard swarm racial power<br/><br/>Your body is an arrangement of inert matter infested with your consciousness. But the spark of your soul is just one part of a much vaster being. Yes, that entity is destroyed and its mind is splintered . . . but if you focus on the shards that make up your form, you can begin to hear the susurrus of a thousand, or perhaps even a thousand thousand other shardmind consciousnesses somewhere “out there.”<br/><br/>With a little more concentration, you can tap into this fantastic network of your fellows and use it to hypercharge your own cognition. You can gain a limited ability to predict the immediate future. You can channel the output of all those minds to enhance your attacks. Sometimes you have the ability to borrow the abilities from other shardminds.<br/><br/>When you manage a particularly clear connection, at times you can predict the future so well that you exploit a foe’s momentary weakness.<br/><br/>All this extra mind power comes at a price; you can get caught up experiencing shadow glimpses from the lives of countless other shardminds. But occasional fugue states do not concern you; they are the price you must pay as you tap the detritus of a mind that might have once equaled a god’s cognition.<br/><br/><h3>CRYSTALMIND  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Psychic Network (11th level)</b>: Choose two skills: Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature, or Religion.
