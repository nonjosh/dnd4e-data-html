		<h1 class="player">Malec-Keth Janissary</h1><p><i>&quot;My oath and sword shall remain unbroken for as long as I draw breath.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage<br/><br/>Malec-Keth janissaries are products of the elite arcane and military practices taught in the Tower of Malec-Keth, a war-magic academy in the City of Brass. Highly disciplined and rigorously trained, Malec-Keth janissaries have a fighting style demonstrative of their mastery of mind and body. They learn offensive and defensive techniques to protect their wards, and they also study music, art, and language.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Malec-Keth janissaries are servants to powerful masters, both humanoid and elemental. Proud and loyal, janissaries are single-minded in defense of their allies and masters. They favor a modest appearance; the only distinguishing mark a janissary bears is the tattoo of single blue flame on the brow that declares him or her a graduate of Malec-Keth. Those who wear the mark of Malec-Keth are known far and wide among the elemental realms for their determination and deadly skill with spell and blade.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many powerful lords and ladies favor janissaries as bodyguards for their defensive abilities. Other Malec- Keth janissaries owe allegiance to no master, preferring to use their training to further their own ambitions.<br/><br/><h3>MALEC-KETH JANISSARY  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chant of War (11th level)</b>: While you are bloodied, your aegis of assault or aegis of shielding power is a close burst 5.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Devshirme Training (11th level)</b>: You gain training in a skill from your class list or gain an additional two languages.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Malec-Keth Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra attack, you ignore your enemies’ resistances until the end of your turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Primordial Blade (16th level)</b>: Years of tireless study and exposure to the forces within the Elemental Chaos have honed your ability to control the elements.
