		<h1 class="player">Deneith Protector</h1><p><i>&quot;I can’t promise that nothing will happen to you while I’m around. I can promise that I’ll see you through whatever perils we face.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Sentinel feat<br/><br/>Deneith’s protectors are among the most storied members of the house’s Defenders Guild, an organization of mercenary bodyguards who are combat veterans. As a protector, you protect your charge with both combat prowess and the supernatural powers of your dragon mark. Although most of your comrades are probably members of the Defenders Guild, you might also find yourself working with the Blademarks Guild—an organization of mercenaries who provide a variety of services throughout Khorvaire—and the Sentinel Marshals, a group that ensures the enforcement of law and order. Your training has honed your skills to protect others, and you relish the opportunity to thwart enemies who try to attack your charges. Those foolish enough to venture such an assault swiftly meet your weapon as you deliver retribution for their audacity.<br/><br/><h3>DENEITH PROTECTOR  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bodyguard's Resolve (11th level)</b>: Whenever you are dazed or stunned and an enemy marked by you targets an ally within your line of sight with an attack, you can make a saving throw against the dazed or stunned effect. If you save, the effect ends before the enemy makes the attack roll against the ally.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sentinel Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you mark each enemy that is adjacent to you when you complete that action. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Deneith Mark (16th level)</b>: Whenever you mark an enemy, you end any marks on you.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Deneith Protector Attack 11</span>Bodyguard's Link</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your dragon mark sends a magic charge into your enemy when you hit, creating a link that lets you divert the foe’s attacks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength or Intelligence vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3[W] + Strength or Intelligence modifier damage, and the next time the target hits an ally with a melee attack before the end of your next turn, you can choose to have the attack instead hit you.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Deneith Protector Utility 12</span>Globe of Warding</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You create a shimmering globe that strengthens allies against attacks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone of protective energy that lasts until the end of your next turn.
