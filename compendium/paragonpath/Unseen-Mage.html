		<h1 class="player">Unseen Mage</h1><p><i>&quot;Have you ever met someone who wasn’t there?&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard<br/><br/>To see but go unseen, to affect the world but remain unaffected by it—this ability is at the heart of true magical power. Thus you have devoted yourself to the art of invisibility, rendering your body as transparent as a window without smear or blemish, through which no hint of your presence can be detected. You are an unseen mage; there is no stopping you. Or, more important, seeing you.<br/>Since you can vanish with great alacrity and facility, you must learn to watch your step to avoid being trampled by your own allies. Even walking invisibly in the street requires constant vigilance, lest some carriage or palanquin unknowingly run you down. And with such great power comes the potential for abuse, against which you must be vigilant.<br/><br/><h3>UNSEEN MAGE  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Enhanced Invisibility (11th level)</b>: Whenever you use an arcane power that turns you invisible, roll a d20 at the end of the invisibility’s duration. On a roll of 10 or higher, you instead remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you make an attack roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unseen Action (11th level)</b>: When you use an action point to take an extra action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unseen Advantage (16th level)</b>: Whenever you use an arcane attack power and hit a target that cannot see you, you deal 1d6 extra damage to the target.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Unseen Mage Attack 11</span>Vanishing Act</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You strike, and in the wink of an eye, are gone.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Implement</b>, <b>Psychic</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Intelligence vs. Will</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 3d6 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You become invisible until the start of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Unseen Mage Utility 12</span>Guillaume's Veil</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You make a series of mystical passes, and you and your companions fade from view.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Illusion</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You and each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target gains invisibility until the end of your next turn or until he or she hits or misses with an attack.
