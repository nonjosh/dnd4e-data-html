		<h1 class="player">Ironstar Mauler</h1><p><i>&quot;Aggression is the key to victory. Get in there and start mixing it up while your enemy is still trying to decide if it wants to fight or not. Hesitation is a luxury we can’t afford.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, Ironstar Student feat<br/><br/>You are a battle-tested master of the Ironstar combat style. You wield a mace or a flail as easily as a graceful elf duelist wields a rapier; in your hands, these cruel weapons are as light and quick as willow switches. You have spent countless hours attaining the necessary balance, concentration, and intuition to use these weapons effectively. With uncanny precision, you can crumple a shield, break a weapon-hand, shatter fangs, or crush a skull.<br/><br/>Beyond mastering the style’s pure physical technique, you have absorbed the attitude and mindset of the Ironstar masters. Your chosen style is more than pure strength and savagery. You recognize that fearlessness, intimidation, and aggression are weapons every bit as important as the maces or flails you wield.<br/><br/>Warriors of different races and lands have developed techniques similar to yours, but none have studied them more carefully—or practiced them more fiercely—than the dwarf masters who originated the Ironstar technique. You have learned from their teachings and become a fierce and tough-minded warrior. You are the first to charge into the fray and the last to leave it. Enemies do well to fear you.<br/><br/><h3>IRONSTAR MAULER  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ironstar Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to attack with a power associated with the Ironstar Student feat or the Ironstar Crusher feat, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20, and you treat the weapon you use for that attack as having the high crit property.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ironstar Master (11th level)</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with maces and flails.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ironstar Expertise (16th level)</b>: Whenever you hit an enemy with a mace or a flail, that enemy takes a -2 penalty to the saving throw against any effect from that attack.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ironstar Mauler Attack 11</span>Devastating Smash</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You deal a powerful blow that leaves your foe open to your allies’ attacks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 2[W] + Strength modifier damage, and the target is dazed and slowed until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Ironstar Mauler Utility 12</span>Ironstar Stance</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You gain extra vigor as long as the battle rages.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the stance ends, if you have no temporary hit points at the start of your turn, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Ironstar Mauler Attack 20</span>Crushing Fury</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You batter your nearby enemies with overpowering blows.
