		<h1 class="player">Anointed Champion</h1><p><i>&quot;Ancient blessings have I spoken over my armaments. I do not fear any power that stands against me.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric<br/><br/>In times long past, when the gods warred with the primordials, the divine armies were arrayed in majestic regalia blessed by angelic armorers with powerful wards against their foes. By long study of holy texts, you have learned those ancient prayers and rites.<br/><br/>As an anointed champion, you ward yourself against your foes by sanctifying the arms and armor you bear into battle with sacred oil and special ceremonies. You speak prayers that have not been heard by mortals for centuries, conferring the ancient blessings upon your companions as well. As you perform your holy tasks, you can feel the pull of history urging you on to the same glory the armies of the gods knew as they bested their enemies in ages past.<br/><br/><h3>ANOINTED CHAMPION  PATH FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Anointed Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.
