Here stories come to die and legends loved by the living can find a permanent resting place. These are the vestiges the mythspeaker deals withâ€”echoes of great heroes both real and fictional, whose tales live on in the world of dreams. As a mythspeaker, you are an ambassador between reality and the world of stories; you draw your strength from legends, and many might want you to bring their stories back to the world. Which tales do you draw upon most? Which ones do you avoid? Do you prefer tales of heroism and stirring battles? Do you better relate to those tainted by darkness?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, History<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Quori<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 15.</p>
