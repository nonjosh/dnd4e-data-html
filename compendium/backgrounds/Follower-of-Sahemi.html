You were one of his first recruits, and you learned the ways of the druids and shamans of the Reaches. How did Sahemi recruit you? What part of his message resonated with you? Do you still believe in Sahemi’s crusade to heal the land, or have you become disillusioned along the way? Have you been inside the Mournland and seen it firsthand?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 154.</p>
