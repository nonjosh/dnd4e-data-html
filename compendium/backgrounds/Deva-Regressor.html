They emerge to take charge of your body and mind, then assume your mindâ€™s rightful place. In this way, you regress to a former life, recalling events, people, and places from another time.

Are there any cues you can use to let your fellow players know when a different personality has taken control?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/388" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 388</a>.</p>
