This faith continues to drive you to this day. If you are a Duulora avenger, you strike with righteous fury borne from your faith, and if you are a hashalaq cleric or paladin, you use charisma and diplomacy to inspire mortals to turn away from darkness. When it comes to battle, psychic power and the radiant force of il-Yannah combine within you to make you a fearsome foe. How can you reflect both aspects of your culture? Are you a kalashtar ardent who falls upon training as a paladin to ref lect your faith? Or have you recently discovered the need to find and destroy those who oppose the light?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Quori<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 14.</p>
