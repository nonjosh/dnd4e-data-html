		<h1   class="player">Monastic</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Society<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psionic<br/></p>You lived for years in a monastery, studying, training, and learning life lessons from your masters. You might have joined the institution to become enlightened, before unexpectedly discovering your untapped potential. You might have been abandoned on the monks’ doorstep, your arrival seen as a sign of fortune and destiny. For you, the monastery might have been a place of too-oppressive discipline that eventually forced you to leave. Alternatively, you might have been free to come and go as you pleased and welcomed in the surrounding community.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your education could have focused on scholarship or martial development. Were you a willing student, or did fate place you inside the monastery’s walls? How did you fare in that environment? Did you have a personal instructor? If so, what was your relationship like? Did you form any lasting friendships? Did you make any enemies? How long has it been since you were at the monastery? Would you be welcomed back if you returned?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Religion<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/210940000" target="_new">Psionic Power</a>, page(s) 120.</p>
