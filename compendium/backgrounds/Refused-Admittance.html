		<h1   class="player">Refused Admittance</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>Despite your natural talent and early skill, the dean of students turned you away, yet you still learned from the academy. Did you purchase lessons from willing students or steal texts while at the academy? Did you challenge students to competitions and duels to study their techniques? Did one instructor disagree with the dean and teach you in secret? Has your anger at the school faded or grown sharper, and is it a broad brush applied to all the school and its students?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/374" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 374</a>, page(s) 20.</p>
