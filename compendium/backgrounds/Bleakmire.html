		<h1   class="player">Bleakmire</h1><p><i>Creeping vines, insect clouds, endless brooding wetlands where death is never far away</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Geography<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>Mist-shrouded wetlands, the Bleakmire is an ominous moor, where tall grasses conceal brackish waters and where gnarled trees struggle for the light just visible through the perpetual haze. Plague, vermin, and poisonous creatures teem in the Bleakmire, making it a dangerous place to explore. Patient crocodiles, disease-carrying insects, blood-sipping bats, stalking predators, and poisonous reptiles conspire to make intruders pay for their trespass.<br/>You grew up in the sodden expanse of the Bleakmire, avoiding the many perils that lie in wait for the unwary. Humans subsist in the Bleakmire in the greatest numbers, but elves, half-orcs, and halflings live here, too. If kobolds are available as a player character race, you might consider that as your racial choice. Bleakmire characters are often insular and protective, traits exhibited by many wardens, but any primal class works well for this homeland.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Draconic<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 130.</p>
