You spent your youth working on a farm not far from the area where you were found. That life<br/>might have been enough for you, for youâ€™ve always felt a deep connection to the earth. However, when your new homeland was attacked by goblin raiders and its citizens were murdered, you felt a presence within your blood that called you to action, and you have been following that call ever since.<br/>Who took you in when you were found? Was that person a loving foster parent or a cruel taskmaster? What experiences in your youth nurtured your apparently inborn connection to the primal spirits, and how has that connection flourished in your adulthood?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Streetwise<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 133.</p>
