What was your noble parent’s title? (Bralani of autumn winds, ghaele of winter, and coure of mischief and strife are examples of the many possible titles.) Do you feel a special affinity for a season, passion, or other natural or emotional phenomenon associated with your parent’s title?

When was the first time you visited the world, and what was your reaction to it?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 181.</p>
