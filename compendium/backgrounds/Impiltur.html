		<h1   class="player">Impiltur</h1><p><i>The star of Impiltur has fallen. The retreat of the sea, coupled with widespread corruption, has led this region into decline. The people of this once-great nation huddle in fear as their kingdom unravels around them.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/></p>Impiltur’s fortunes failed when the Sea of Fallen Stars withdrew, drying up the vibrant ports of the cities that served as the heart of commerce. In addition, the death of the last royal, King Imbrar II, during the Year of Blue Fire ended the long reign of the monarchy and shifted power to the lords of the remaining cities. Now collectively called the Grand Council, the lords have proven to be inept at rule, impotent in the face of their nation’s inexorable decay. They do nothing to combat the spreading stain of demon worship that holds Impiltur in the grip of terror.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>Add the higher of your Wisdom score or your Constitution score to your starting hit points (instead of automatically adding your Constitution score).
