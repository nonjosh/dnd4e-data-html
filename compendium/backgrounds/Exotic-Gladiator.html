		<h1   class="player">Exotic Gladiator</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Racial<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn<br/></p>You have fought for sport—not for your own enjoyment, but for the entertainment of others. You were popular because of your exotic race and your great strength, drawing crowds to see your exploits in the arena, to watch you fight and kill monsters and other humanoids in battle. You might have been a slave in a hobgoblin city, or perhaps you fought in secret, illegal rings within a human settlement.<br/><br/>How long did you fight? Were you generally successful, or did you barely stay alive through a short and inglorious career? Did you fight willingly, or were you forced to do it? Did you perhaps enjoy it? Why have you now stopped? Did you escape slavery, or win your freedom in an important match? Or did a wealthy patron see something in you that your masters didn’t, and purchase you from them? Did any of your fellow adventurers fight alongside or perhaps against you?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Athletics<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251200000" target="_new">Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn</a>, page(s) 17.</p>
