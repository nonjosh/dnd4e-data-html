Were you a cutpurse, a burglar, a grifter, or something else? Were you driven to thievery by necessity? Were you part of a guild or syndicate, or harassed by one as an independent operator? Are you still a member or still hunted? If so, where is the guild based? If not, why did you leaveâ€”or why did the guild let you be? Was the parting amicable or are there people out there looking to settle a score with you?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Stealth, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Secret Language<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/373" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 373</a>, page(s) 8.</p>
