Called the white riders for their gleaming armor and the winter wolves they ride, the riders have a ferocity that fey peoples across the lands fear. You were a raider and innocent blood stains your hands. Why were you chosen to become a white rider? Whom did you raid? What experiences haunt you? If none, why did you leave the white riders?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/384" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 384</a>, page(s) 62.</p>
