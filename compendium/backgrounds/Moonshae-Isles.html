Home to two human cultures, the druidic Ffolk and the seafaring Northlanders, the Moonshae Isles are beset by encroaching threats from the Feywild and Amnian mercenaries bent on conquest.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/></p>The Moonshae Isles are a land apart from the rest of Faerûn, marked by towering mountains, dark forests, and ancient rings of standing stones. The realm of House Kendrick, nominally the royal family of the entire archipelago, has been reduced to the isle of Alaron. The isle of Snowdown has fallen under the sway of Amnian mercenaries, while the Northlander kingdoms of Oman and Moray have been abandoned to fomorians (a race of giants from the Feywild) and savage lycanthropes who serve the bloodthirsty beastgod Malar.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You know Elven as an additional language, and you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against charm and fear effects.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 112.</p>
