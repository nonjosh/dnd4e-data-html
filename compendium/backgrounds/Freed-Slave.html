After years of suffering, your deliverance—whether by force of arms or by subterfuge—inspired you to repay the favor. Who enslaved you? Were they regular masters, hailing from the common races, or were they supernatural overlords, such as mind flayers, drow, or vampires? Do you seek to eradicate slavery altogether, or do you focus on freeing one slave at a time? Do you see slavery as another facet of a harsh world, trying not to think too much about those still in chains?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you afraid of returning to the site of your forced labor? Maybe your old masters might recognize you and try to take away your freedom again. Or perhaps you still have friends or family among the slaves there?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enduring years of labor has made you strong and resilient, the better to face the challenges ahead.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/386" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 386</a>, page(s) 68.</p>
