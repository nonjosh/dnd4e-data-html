		<h1   class="player">Sellsword</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Racial<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling<br/></p>Mercenary isn’t quite the right word. It sounds too formal, too militaristic. No, you worked for a living, and as ugly as that work got, it put food on the table and coins in your purse. Your life as a hired sword wasn’t easy—and you have the scars to prove it—yet those who crossed you always got the worse end of the bargain.<br/><br/>Why was fighting for money the best way to make a living? Are you still for hire? Did your work earn you a reputation, and is it one you welcome or regret? What kinds of jobs did you take—pushing around merchants, shadowy bodyguard work for a spoiled noble, or something much worse? Were there jobs you wouldn’t take? Does anyone still owe you pay? Did you make any enemies while working for others’ interests?<br/><br/>Sellsword is a good background for fighters and warlords, but as a ranger or rogue your employment might have put you in more secretive roles. Perhaps instead of a soldier you were a scout, or rather than an armed guard you acted as a plainclothes bodyguard.<br/><br/>Consider feats that emphasize your history as someone who lived by the blade. Nimble Blade, Quick Draw, and Toughness might be good choices.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253830000" target="_new">Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling</a>, page(s) 16.</p>
