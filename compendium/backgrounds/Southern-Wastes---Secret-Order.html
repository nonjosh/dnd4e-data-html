		<h1   class="player">Southern Wastes - Secret Order</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Geography<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Dark Sun<br/></p>You belong to an elemental cult or a priesthood, a secret society that teaches reverence for the primal power sleeping in the worldâ€™s sand, stone, and sky. Perhaps you were brought to a hidden shrine as a child and raised there, or you might have met a wandering teacher or half-mad seer who tutored you in the power of the elements. Does your order have a high purpose, such as the restoration of Athas or the destruction of the sorcerer-kings? Does your order still exist, or are you the last member?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 182.</p>
