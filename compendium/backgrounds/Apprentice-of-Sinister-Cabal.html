You are part of a secret group that wields arcane power for a dark, mysterious purpose—and there might be secrets within the cabal that you don’t know about yet. How were you recruited into this cabal, and what is their professed aim? Do you have mentors, friends, or rivals in the cabal? Are you still an active member, or have you left the cabal temporarily or permanently?<br/>Good Background: Warlock.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Arcana and Dungeoneering to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Arcana and Dungeoneering checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 61.</p>
