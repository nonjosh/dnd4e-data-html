What is it going to take for you to retire once again?<br/>Good Background: Warlord.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You gain a +1 bonus to initiative checks, you add History to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to History checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 61.</p>
