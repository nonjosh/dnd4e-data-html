Or is there bad blood between you and your former associates? You have learned to remain unseen when pursued and to stand your ground when you have nowhere to turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Stealth<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/390" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 390</a>.</p>
