Perhaps you were raised by preternaturally intelligent animals in the wild, under the tutelage of the primal spirits, or you might have been born in a very remote tribe. You’re accustomed to the natural order and to nature’s form of justice. You enjoy a deep connection to the primal spirits, and you might never have heard of the distant gods of the Astral Sea. You are reverent toward plants and animals, and might call them friends far more readily than you extend that term to other humanoids. <br/>How and by whom were you raised? How do you react to civilization once you encounter it? With wide-eyed wonder or grim disdain?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 133.</p>
