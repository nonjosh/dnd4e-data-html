Which enclave did you guard? What unusual or famous fugitives did you meet while guarding the enclave? Did you ever break up a conflict among those who sought Ghallanda’s hospitality, and does someone owe you thanks or bear a grudge as a result? Did you ever smuggle people out of your enclave—or kick them out because they were threatening others?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Insight<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 153.</p>
