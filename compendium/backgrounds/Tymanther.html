The dragonborn citizens of this new nation are a proud race of warriors, known for their hatred of dragons and their ilk.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/></p>The devastation unleashed by the Spellplague ripped a portion of the dragonborn-ruled nation of Tymanchebar from Abeir and deposited it on the dying remnants of Unther, wiping out the regionâ€™s human population and replacing it with a large population of dragonborn. Under the leadership of the dragonborn army, the new immigrants constructed the citadelcity of Djerad Thymar and set about establishing their domination of the surrounding realm. Their new nation, Tymanther, is ruled by a dragonborn who is elected from the ranks of the military elite to hold the title of Vanquisher.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Athletics to your class skill list, and you gain a +2 bonus to Athletics checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 124.</p>
