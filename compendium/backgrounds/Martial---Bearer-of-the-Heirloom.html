		<h1   class="player">Martial - Bearer of the Heirloom</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>You have inherited a martial heirloom that has been passed through the generations. It might be a weapon, a shield, a helmet, a scabbard, a quiver, or any other piece of equipment. You and your family cherish the heirloom for its connection to your heritage. Perhaps the item played a pivotal role in a historic battle or was a beloved possession of a famous ancestor. The heirloom might also be the subject of a legend. Regardless of the itemâ€™s history, you have acquired it through merit, necessity, or perhaps greed. How does your ownership of the item affect your decisions? How do you feel about being its owner? Do you shrink under the mantle of obligation and responsibility, or do you rise up to earn stewardship of the item?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Intimidate<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251230000" target="_new">Martial Power 2</a>, page(s) 153.</p>
