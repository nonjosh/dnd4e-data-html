They needn’t have bothered—the sight alone of the terrible apparitions had you scurrying for the exit. Some in your village tried to fight, but to no avail. Their pitchforks and swords passed harmlessly through the spirits, while the ghosts’ spectral weapons slashed your friends’ bodies. Phantom arrows flickering with pale flames ignited real fires in the buildings. Hot blood steamed on icy ground.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fled with many others, and in the days of travel that followed, more died from starvation,  sickness, exhaustion, and cold.

When you got back to civilization, you resolved to find out.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature, Religion<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/39865000" target="_new">Into the Unknown: The Dungeon Survival Handbook</a>, page(s) 102.</p>
