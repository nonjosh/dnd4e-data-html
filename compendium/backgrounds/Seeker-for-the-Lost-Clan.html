And on a fundamental level, why do you want to find them so intensely?<br/>Good Background: Dwarf.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add History and Dungeoneering to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to History and Dungeoneering checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 54.</p>
