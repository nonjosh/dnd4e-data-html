Unfortunately, one of your missions triggered a terrible curse, and the curator of your chapter cast you out, unwilling to risk the curse falling upon the rest of the order. What is the nature of your curse? Do you seek a cure, or are you resigned to live with the consequences? What artifact cursed you? Do you have it still, or is it in the hands of the Collectors? Perhaps you were part of a team prior to your current adventuring party. Were they also cursed, and if so, what happened to them?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Supernal<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 79.</p>
