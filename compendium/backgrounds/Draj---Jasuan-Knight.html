You spent your youth scouring the surrounding lands for enemies, monsters, spies, and captives to bring back for sacrifice. You might have been sent out into the world to meet the demands of a horoscope drawn for you by the calmec scribes, or perhaps you fled Draj to avoid a blood feud with another clan. Were you blamed for the death of a fellow jasuan knight and exiled, or did the bloody cruelty of the moon priests finally push you into a crisis of conscience?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Religion, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Abyssal<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 148.</p>
