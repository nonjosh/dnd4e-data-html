		<h1   class="player">Arcane Tracker</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Society<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>You are on the trail of a wondrous thing. It might be a manifestation that appears only under a full moon or an eclipse, a spellwarped beast whose rampages lash into the world from another plane, a lich assassin who killed your master and stole relics meant for you, or a demon child who rides an albino serpent through the dreams of its hapless victims. You pledged yourself to this hunt, knowing full well that the nature of your quarry could lead you far across the world and perhaps even beyond it. You know that when you finally catch what you are chasing, a great trove of arcane knowledge will be yours for the taking.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 159.</p>
