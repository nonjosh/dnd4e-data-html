Are you specially pious, seeing omens everywhere? How did your family and friends react to your choice of career? Were you indoctrinated by another Pledged Scout, or were you a self-taught mystic? As a Pledged Scout you tend not to stay put for long. Do you have a hard time making friends, or do you leave behind a network of acquaintances that make you feel welcome whenever you return? Do you dream of one day crossing the forest paths of the Feywild, or perhaps reaching Arvandor?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are at home in the wilderness, wondering what’s over the next horizon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/386" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 386</a>, page(s) 68.</p>
