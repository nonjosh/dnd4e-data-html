You spent your youth training to join their ranks, during which time you studied the ancient texts and learned to despise those ancient foes. Such indoctrination does not leave its students unchanged. How does your upbringing shape your present views? Is there one particular group for<br/>which you harbor a special grudge? What would happen when you encounter the object of your hate? Since you are no longer serving as a Keeper, what drew you from the stronghold? Are you on a mission? Or are you a survivor from an attack?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Intimidate<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/383" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 383</a>, page(s) 74.</p>
