Yet destructive forces thrive, working relentlessly to bring the world to ruin. If left unchecked, you know they shall succeed. This is inevitable. You left your home to seek out evil and annihilate it. Perhaps you do this out of conscience, honor, vengeance, or out of shame for your savage heritage.
