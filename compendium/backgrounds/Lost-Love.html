Was it a romantic partner, a family member, or a good friend? Was someone responsible for the death or departure of your loved one, or was it a cruel trick of life? Do you use this empathy to prevent others from suffering the same fate? How do you react to those who steal away loved ones, such as kidnappers or a mischievous fey? Do you favor bounties and quests aimed at rescuing relatives, or do you undertake those missions expecting no reward?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how you lost a loved one, your heart guides you and helps you understand and appeal to the hearts of others.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/386" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 386</a>, page(s) 67.</p>
