The event that revealed this ability to you forever changed the course of your life. Perhaps in the middle of debilitating illness you began babbling in Supernal before miraculously being healed. During your investiture you might have been struck by visions that appeared to last for days in which you spoke with an avatar of your deity. You might have witnessed portents during a short walk through the wilderness, only to return home and discover you had been gone for a week while the events that were foretold during your journey come to pass. Regardless of how you awakened to your gifts, you have now become an instrument of prophecy.
