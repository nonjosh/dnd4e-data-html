The echo planes—the Feywild and the Shadowfell—are not entirely cut off from the spirits’ power, but the spirits are much weaker there, where other powers hold sway. You are native to the Feywild, where arcane magic courses through every leaf and blade of grass. You always felt an affinity for and a sensitivity to that magic, a constant awareness of its hum through the wild places of your home.
