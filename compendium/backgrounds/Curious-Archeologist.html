		<h1   class="player">Curious Archeologist</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Legacy of Acererak<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>Dungeons, ruins, and old tombs house the secrets of the past, and dedicated scrutiny can reveal much of old civilizations and famous personages. So whenever an opportunity arises to examine a historical sight, you’re loath to let it pass you by. While many dungeons capture your imagination, none of them has quite the same allure as does the Tomb of Horrors.<br/>Possible Minor Quests: You might explore the corridors of Acererak’s tomb, retrieve relics from the deep chambers, or seek lore about who Acererak was in life.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Perception, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>When engaging in a skill challenge to disable a trap, your first successful Thievery check grants you an extra success.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/371" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 371</a>, page(s) 6.</p>
