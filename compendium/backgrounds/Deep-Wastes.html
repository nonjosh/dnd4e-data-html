Though Valan Jaelre's drow have grown in numbers lately, most societies in the sparsely populated tunnels of the Wastes remain small.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much do you know about Valan Jaelre? What sort of dealings have you had with the drow under Old Skull? Did you suspect the drow might be planning to attack Shadowdale? Why did you travel to the surface instead of staying in the Underdark?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Event.aspx?x=dnd/4new/event/dndencounters" target="_new">Web of the Spider Queen</a>.</p>
