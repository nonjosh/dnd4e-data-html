		<h1   class="player">Lucky Child</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>You were born when, by all rights, such a birth should have been impossible, making you either a blessing or a curse for your surprised parents. Since a young age, you have been told that you owe your existence to the forces of luck, and you have developed a keen understanding of how chance conspires to influence reality. Perhaps your parents were old, or maybe you were born despite a hex against your bloodline. Perhaps a prophecy predicted your death but, unlike all the others, you survived.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was your birth such a quirk of fate? Is there a purpose to your birth, or do you seem to beat the odds wherever you go? Has your origin led you to question the odds, or do you fear youâ€™ve used up all your luck just by being born?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Religion<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/388" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 388</a>.</p>
