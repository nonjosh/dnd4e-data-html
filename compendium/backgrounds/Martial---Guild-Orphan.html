		<h1   class="player">Martial - Guild Orphan</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>After you were abandoned, members of the thieves’ guild took you in. You have a mastery over locks, traps, and mechanical devices that is possible only for one who has grown up with thieves’ tools as toys. Your upbringing has left you with a distorted view of society. Unless one member of the thieves’ guild took you under his or her wing, you probably suffered cruelty during your childhood. A thieves’ guild rarely lets its members walk away to pursue other careers. The guild expects a lifetime of service in return for training and care. If you are not still part of the guild that raised you, then the guild either found a good reason to let you go, or it’s hunting you right now.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Thievery<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251230000" target="_new">Martial Power 2</a>, page(s) 153.</p>
