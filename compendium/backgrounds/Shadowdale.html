		<h1   class="player">Shadowdale</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Encounters<br/></p>You're a native of Shadowdale, well familiar with the stories of drow invasions from under Old Skull. Your homeland shows few signs that the drow once ruled it. These days, pastoral farmlands stretch out around Old Skull, and the great wizard Elminster protects the area. Or at least he usually does. Elminster is often away, and his magical wards aren't as strong as they once were.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you grow up in Shadowdale or did you settle in the area later? What close ties to the town do you have? What possessions or people do you feel a need to protect? Have you met Elminster? Have you worked with him the past or been inspired by him?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Event.aspx?x=dnd/4new/event/dndencounters" target="_new">Web of the Spider Queen</a>.</p>
