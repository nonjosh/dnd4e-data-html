		<h1   class="player">Wilderness Loner</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Racial<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn<br/></p>The wilderness is your home, far from any city or village. You might have been a fugitive from a dragonbonded clan, eking out your livelihood from the remote forest, swamp, or desert near your clanâ€™s holdings. Or perhaps you were an orphan, stranded in the wilderness as a youth when your parent met a terrible end. Or the parent who raised you might have been an exile, a fugitive, or simply an ornery loner who preferred solitude to the company of others. Whatever the reason, you have lived for years by your own wits and resourcefulness, without having to rely on anyone else.<br/><br/>What has changed to bring you closer to civilization and into a party of adventurers? Did a new population of monsters make your wilderness home suddenly inhospitable? Or perhaps a new frontier settlement was established near your territory, bringing you unwillingly into contact with this outpost of civilization. Maybe you were captured by hobgoblin slavers and only just won your freedom. How will you adapt to your new circumstances? Will you be able to trust your new allies enough to rely on them? Can you handle the burden of having others relying on you?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251200000" target="_new">Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn</a>, page(s) 17.</p>
