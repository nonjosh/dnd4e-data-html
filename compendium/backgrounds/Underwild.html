		<h1   class="player">Underwild</h1><p><i>Twisting corridors, subterranean gardens, fearsome horrors that have never seen daylight</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Geography<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>The Underdark crawls with vile abominations that shun the rays of the sun. Populated by creatures such as drow and mind flayers, the place is known for its violent and cruel denizens. Still, not all areas are overrun by such sinister inhabitants. Certain places, far from the frequently traveled corridors, are filled with eddies and swirls of primal power, spawning new life out of the ruins of old. Such places are called the Underwild, and in them fungus forests, sweeps of phosphorescent mold, and slime pools gather primal energy for use by those who have the courage to seize it. Those who discover the Underwild also find abundant food, water, and other resources to help them survive the otherwise desolate Underdark.<br/>Originating from the Underdark, you have seen its wonders and its wickedness. Drow is the best racial choice for this homeland, and the dark elves make interesting barbarians and druids. Of course, any race that has strong ties to the Underdark can work as well.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Deep Speech, Elven<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 132.</p>
