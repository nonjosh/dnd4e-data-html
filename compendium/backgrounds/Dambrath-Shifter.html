		<h1   class="player">Dambrath (Shifter)</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shifter<br/></p>If the shifter race has a homeland in the Realms, it might be the dry plains of Dambrath in the Scarred South. Before the Spellplague, Dambrath was a land of barbaric humans enslaved by the Crinti, a half-drow elite. During the Spellplague, the humans turned to emergent primal powers and lycanthropes that resembled their old tribal totems to drive out the Crinti. Today, shifters are common among Dambrath’s nomadic tribes, sharing tents and horselines with their human cohorts. Shifters are thought to be blessed by Malar, bestial exarch of the Dambrathan’s patron deity, Silvanus.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come from one of Dambrath’s famous nomadic tribes. They say Dambrathans are born ahorse, and your skills with a mount lend proof to the adage. What is your tribe’s totem? Were any natural lycanthropes in your tribe? How peaceful or brutal were your people, and why have you ranged so far from them?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>While you are riding a creature, you can reroll any Acrobatics, Athletics, Endurance, or Stealth check using the creature’s skill check bonus rather than your own. You must use the second result.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/394" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 394</a>.</p>
