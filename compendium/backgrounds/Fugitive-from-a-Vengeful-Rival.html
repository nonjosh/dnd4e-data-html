There was a falling out, followed by several impromptu duels and an abrupt departure.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path <br/></p>You’ve angered someone powerful enough to make you a fugitive. Every month brings new evidence that your rival’s wrath hasn’t waned: a bounty hunter, trouble with the authorities, or posters indicated yet another increase in the price on your head. What event caused you to take flight? How long have you been on the run, and what lands have you traveled through on the way? Is there something other than your death that will end the chase? Are you trying to escape, or will you ultimately turn the tables on your rival?<br/>Good Background: Ranger.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Bluff and Stealth to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Bluff and Stealth checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 60.</p>
