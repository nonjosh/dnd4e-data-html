How did you learn your initial training in the combat arts? Why haven’t you resorted to out-and-out banditry? What places have you visited in your wandering? What would it take for you to settle down?<br/>Good Background: Dragonborn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Intimidate to your class skill list and give yourself a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 54.</p>
