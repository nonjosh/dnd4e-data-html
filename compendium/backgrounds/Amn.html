		<h1   class="player">Amn</h1><p><i>In Amn, everything has a price. From assassins and slaves to art and artifacts, the nation offers an indulgence or a vice for everyone. The laws can be strict for those without a coin or two for the right bribe at the right time. Around every street corner and bend in the road, Amn might hold the opportunity of a lifetime—or a cutthroat waiting to end your life.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/></p>Five wealthy and powerful merchant houses control Amn. These so-called High Houses form the governing Council of Five, which has complete authority over the nation and keeps a close check on all mercantile and military activity. Through the efforts of the council, Amn has amassed a formidable fleet of ships to guard and transport goods across western Faerûn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amn is widely disliked, but it has avoided major conflicts through a combination of scheming, intimidation, and pragmatism. Many foreign nobles and merchants have made fortunes through dealings with Amn. It is a land where luck counts for little, and where shrewdness and acumen determine one’s success and survival.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Streetwise and Thievery to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Streetwise checks and Thievery checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 80.</p>
