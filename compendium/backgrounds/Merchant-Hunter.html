Or your pack might occupy a successful position in a city or trading outpost. What is your place in thri-kreen society and the wider world? Do you still have ties to your pack, or have you gone into exile for some reason? Is the new direction your pack has taken a good thing, or is it a perversion of thri-kreen custom? Do you still serve pack interests?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/411" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 411</a>.</p>
