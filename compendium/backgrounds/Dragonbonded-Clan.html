		<h1   class="player">Dragonbonded Clan</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Racial<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn<br/></p>Your clan is still bonded to the service of a dragon, just as it was before the rise of Arkhosia. Your people do not live among other races, but in the remote wilderness near your patron dragonâ€™s lair. The ways of other races and their civilizations are foreign to you, and to their eyes you might seem barbaric or uncultured. Why have you left your close-knit clan, and its service to your dragon patron? Or do you perhaps adventure in service to that patron? Is your patron benevolent, or cruel and domineering?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Intimidate<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251200000" target="_new">Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
