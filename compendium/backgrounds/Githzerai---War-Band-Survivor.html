		<h1   class="player">Githzerai - War Band Survivor</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Racial<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/><b>Prerequisite: </b>Githzerai<br/></p>You joined a githzerai war band that either traveled to the world or originated in it. Your band sought enemies of the githzerai and found foes beyond your group’s capabilities. Only you survived the battle. What happened to the rest of your band? You might be stranded in the world with no easy route home, but do you want to go home? Is the shame of your band’s defeat, or perhaps the shame of your survival, too great? Do you seek vengeance for the death of your companions or absolution for the guilt you feel as a survivor?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Perception<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
