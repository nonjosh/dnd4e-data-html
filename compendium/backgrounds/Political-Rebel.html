Perhaps the nobles are oppressing the serfs, the church is quashing religious rivals, the king is crushing the trade guilds, or the guilds are suppressing independent mercantilists. You’re on the side of the underdog, and you’ve escalated the struggle beyond words to direct action. Against whom are you rebelling? Are you part of a larger revolutionary cell, or do you act alone? What will things look like when you’ve won? What put you on the adventurer’s path?<br/>Good Background: Rogue.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Diplomacy and Streetwise to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Diplomacy and Streetwise checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 60.</p>
