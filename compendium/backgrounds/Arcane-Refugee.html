		<h1   class="player">Arcane Refugee</h1><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Society<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>A great conflagration of magic enveloped your home when you were a child. Your family fled, and your parents became bitter, angry people who denounced spells and those who worked them.<br/>Your family never explained to you the nature of the magical disaster that destroyed your home (and perhaps even the city or region where you lived as a child). This event stirred a great curiosity in you because of a strange red scar you have on the back of your hand—a remnant of your flight from the disaster. Some nights, the scar glimmers with its own light.<br/>You began secretly exploring arcane magic. Your study was enhanced when you found an old locked chest in your surviving parents’ chamber. It was filled with dusty, old books describing arcane fields of study. Before long, you were working basic spells on your own—but then your parents found out. You were banished and commanded never to return.<br/>You wander now, looking for ways to increase your arcane knowledge and trying to discover more about the magical disaster that overshadows your life.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 159.</p>
