		<h1   class="player">Eldritch Harlequin</h1><p><i>I’m the fly in the proverbial ointment, I suppose. But I’ve never been much for proverbs. They’re just rules that happen to rhyme sometimes.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path <br/></p>Your tie to the mysterious and fey places in the world is particularly strong. You’ve always been a mischievous sort—a troublemaker, and the person who upsets the apple-cart just to see how far the apples will roll. What sorts of trouble has your mischief resulted in? Are there partners in crime in your past, and what’s your relationship with them like? How does someone inclined to mischief make a living? Under what circumstances can you overcome your natural instinct and toe the line?<br/>Good Background: Eladrin.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Bluff and Thievery to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Bluff and Thievery checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 55.</p>
