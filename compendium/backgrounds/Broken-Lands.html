		<h1   class="player">Broken Lands</h1><p><i>Great canyons and towering earth spires, spectacularly striated rock, dry and thirsty soil</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Geography<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General<br/></p>The Broken Lands are an arid region marked by dramatic natural features: ravines, rock spires, and steep slopes with colorfully patterned striations. Vegetation is sparse, and rainfall is infrequent but intense. Drakes and lions hunt a variety of prey through the canyons. The cliffs, loose soil, and patches of slick clay make traversing the Broken Lands difficult, so travelers are rare and roads are unknown. The people of the Broken Lands, mostly dwarves and orcs, war with each other for what few resources the dry land has to offer.<br/>You were born in the Broken Lands and grew up accustomed to hardship. The ways of the world beyond your homeland are strange to you, and youâ€™re marked by a strong competitive streak. Barbarians are the most common primal characters from the Broken Lands, but druids and shamans are also good options.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Languages: </i>Dwarven, Giant<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 131.</p>
