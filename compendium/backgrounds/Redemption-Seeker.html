Perhaps it was a moment of ill-considered rage, a flirtation outside society’s boundaries, or maybe you took the blame for someone else’s lack of honor. Ever since, you have been striving to act impeccably and with such valor that you redeem yourself for the transgression in your past. What great event started your quest for redemption? Is there anyone trying to thwart your efforts? Have you given any thought to what will happen after you balance the scales of honor?<br/>Good Background: Dragonborn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You add Diplomacy and Insight to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Diplomacy and Insight checks.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 54.</p>
