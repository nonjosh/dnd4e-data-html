Breland has vast tracts of workable land—it is one of the major food producers of Khorvaire—as well as a society of great personal freedoms, which has inspired immense loyalty and patriotism in its citizenry. The Brelish are proud of their heritage and consider themselves cosmopolitan, and the nation currently leads all others in social progress. Breland’s people are convinced that their social and economic advancements will keep them at the forefront of the Five Nations for generations to come.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 125.</p>
