		<h1   class="player">Calimshan</h1><p><i>Calimshan’s unforgiving desert can sear the skin and strip the bones of the unwary traveler, but its inhabitants pose the greatest danger. War has ravaged the landscape of the former human nation, leaving it even more desolate than before. Two forces contest the land: the genasi followers of Calim and those of his nemesis, Memnon.</i></p><p class="flavortext"><b>Type: </b>Campaign<br/><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms<br/></p>When the Calimemnon Crystal shattered during the Spellplague, it released the djinn Calim and his rival, the efreet Memnon, to resume their millennia-old war, ushering in the Second Era of Skyfire. Calim and Memnon overthrew Calimshan’s government and marshaled forces of efreets, djinns, genasi, and human slaves. What was once a prohibition against elemental races became an open invitation to any who would offer allegiance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of war, without warning or reason, the two great entities disappeared again. But strife between their followers did not end. Some outsiders refer to the contested area as the Skyfire Emirates.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Benefit: </i>You gain resist 4 fire and a +5 bonus to Endurance checks made due to thirst.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11th level, your resistance improves to 7. At 21st level, it improves to 10.<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 84.</p>
