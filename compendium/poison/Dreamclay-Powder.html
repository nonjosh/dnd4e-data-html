A successful saving throw has no effect against this condition, but a failure worsens it.<br/><b><i>First Failed Saving Throw:</i></b> The target is stunned instead of dazed (save ends). A successful saving throw has no effect against this condition, but a failure worsens it.<br/><b><i>Second Failed Saving Throw:</i></b> The target falls unconscious for 8 hours, instead of being stunned. The target regains consciousness if it takes nonpsychic damage while it is bloodied.<br/><b>Special:</b> Dreamclay is an ingested poison. The poison makes its attack 5 minutes after a creature consumes a dose of it. A successful DC 26 Nature check or Perception check can reveal the presence of dreamclay in food or drink to someone actively searching for it.<br/></p><p>Published in <a href="" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 188</a>.</p>
