		<h1 class="player">Basic Attack</h1><p class="flavor">When a power or other effect allows a creature to make a basic attack, the creature can make either a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack. If the power or other effect specifically calls for a melee basic attack or a ranged basic attack, the creature must use that type. For instance, a power might read, “Each ally within 5 squares of you can make a basic attack as a free action,” which means each of those allies can make either a melee or a ranged basic attack, and they can each do so as a free action, rather than a standard action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some classes provide alternatives to these default powers, and each monster has its own basic attack power, which is noted in its stat block with a circle around the power’s icon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature uses a melee basic attack to make an opportunity attack or to make a charge attack. Even if it has no weapon equipped, it can make a melee basic attack using an unarmed strike (such as a kick or punch) or another improvised weapon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature can make a ranged basic attack as long as it has something to throw or shoot. Even if it has no ranged weapon equipped, it can make a ranged basic attack using an improvised weapon. If it makes the attack using a weapon that has the heavy thrown property, the attack uses the creature’s Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 287, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 238.</p>
