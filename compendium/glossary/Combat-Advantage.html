		<h1 class="player">Combat Advantage</h1><p class="flavor">One of the most common attack roll modifiers is combat advantage, which represents a situation in which a target can’t give full attention to defense. The target is pressed by multiple enemies at the same time, stunned, distracted, or otherwise caught off guard. Combat advantage has two rules.<br/><br/>+2 Bonus to Attack Rolls: A creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against a target granting combat advantage to it.<br/><br/>Able to See Target: A creature must be able to see a target to gain combat advantage against it. This rule means a blinded creature cannot have combat advantage against anyone.<br/><br/>Once per encounter, a creature can try to gain combat advantage against a target by making a Bluff check.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat advantage is relative. In any given pair of combatants, either, both, or neither might have combat advantage against the other. It’s possible for a single creature to be adjacent to one enemy that has combat advantage against it and a second enemy that does not.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 279, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217207200" target="_new">Monster Manual</a>, page(s) 280, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 217.</p>
