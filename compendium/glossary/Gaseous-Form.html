		<h1 class="player">Gaseous Form</h1><p class="flavor">The monster’s body is similar to a cloud of gas, or the monster can take this form. (All of the monster’s gear is absorbed into its gaseous form.) While gaseous, the monster is insubstantial and gains a fly speed equal to its land speed, as well as the ability to hover.<br/><br/>A monster cannot make attacks while in gaseous form unless otherwise noted, but it can move unhindered through porous obstacles that would otherwise prevent movement (such as under a door or through a cracked window).</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217207200" target="_new">Monster Manual</a>, page(s) 281.</p>
