		<h1 class="player">Keeping Watch</h1><p class="flavor">Adventurers typically take turns keeping watch while their companions sleep. If five characters are in your group, each of you can take a turn on watch duty for 1½ hours and sleep for 6 hours, so that you spend a total of 7½ hours resting.<br/><br/>When it’s your turn on watch, you actively look for signs of danger. When you start your shift on watch, make a Perception check. If something occurs during your watch, the DM uses the result of your Perception check to determine whether you notice.<br/><br/>If your entire group sleeps at the same time without setting a watch, the DM uses your individual passive Perception scores, counting the –5 penalty for being asleep, to determine whether you hear approaching danger and wake up.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 263.</p>
