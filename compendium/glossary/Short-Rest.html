		<h1 class="player">Short Rest</h1><p class="flavor">A short rest allows a creature to regain the use of encounter powers and spend healing surges to regain hit points. Short rests follow these rules.<br/><br/>Duration: A short rest is about 5 minutes long.<br/><br/>No Limit per Day: A creature can take an unlimited number of short rests per day.<br/><br/>No Strenuous Activity: Resting means just that. The creature can stand guard, sit in place, ride on a wagon or other vehicle, or do other tasks that don’t require much exertion.<br/><br/>Regain the Use of Powers: After a short rest, a creature regains the use of expended encounter powers.<br/><br/>Spend Healing Surges: After a short rest, a creature can spend as many healing surges as desired (see “Hit Points and Healing,” page 255). A creature that runs out of healing surges must take an extended rest to regain them.<br/><br/>Using Powers during the Rest: If a creature uses an encounter power (such as a healing power) during a short rest, it needs another short rest to regain the use of that power.<br/><br/>Interruptions: If a creature’s short rest is interrupted, the creature needs to rest for another 5 minutes to get the benefits of a short rest.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 263, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 172.</p>
