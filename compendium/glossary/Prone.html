However, if the creature is climbing or flying, it falls.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way the creature can move is by crawling, teleporting, or being pulled, pushed, or slid.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The creature grants combat advantage to attackers making melee attacks against it, but it gains a +2 bonus to all defenses against ranged attacks from attackers that arenâ€™t adjacent to it.<br/><br/>A creature can end this condition on itself by standing up. A creature can drop prone as a minor action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition can affect limbless creatures, such as fish and snakes, as well as amorphous creatures, such as oozes. When such a creature falls prone, imagine it is writhing or unsteady, rather than literally lying down. The game effect on that creature is the same as for other creatures.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 277, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 222, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 232, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/283640000" target="_new">Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale</a>, page(s) 124.</p>
