		<h1 class="player">Staff (implement)</h1><p class="flavor">A staff is a shaft, usually of wood, that is typically as tall as or slightly taller than its wielder. Staffs are sometimes crowned with decorative crystals or other symbols of magical power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implement also counts as a quarterstaff. Even a creature who doesnâ€™t have proficiency with the staff as an implement can use it as a weapon, but if the staff is magical, the creature cannot use its properties or powers, only its enhancement bonus and critical hit effect.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 274.</p>
