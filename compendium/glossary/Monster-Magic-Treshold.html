		<h1 class="player">Monster Magic Treshold</h1><p class="flavor">A monster equipped with magic items can use the powers those items grant. <br/><br/>Enhancement Bonuses: A monster benefits from an enhancement bonus to attack rolls, defenses, or  AC only if that bonus is higher than its magic threshold, as shown on the table below.<br/><br/>A monster’s magic threshold is an abstract representation of its equipment, power, and general effectiveness against characters of its level. If you give the monster a magic item that grants a bonus  to attack rolls and damage rolls or to defenses, subtract the magic threshold from that bonus before you apply it.<br/><br/>For example, if you give that 8th-level ogre savage a +2 magic greatclub, you add only a +1 bonus to its attack rolls and damage rolls, since its magic threshold is +1<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Monster Level</th><th>Magic Threshold</th></tr><tr><td>1st–5th</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>6th–10th</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>11th–15th</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>16th–20th</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>21st–25th</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>26th–30th</td><td>+5</td></tr></table></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217507200" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, page(s) 174.</p>
