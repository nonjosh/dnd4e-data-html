		<h1 class="player">Vision and Special Senses</h1><p class="flavor">Many creatures see in the dark much better than humans do. Some can even see in utter lightlessness. Other creatures get along in the dark by using other senses: uncanny hearing, sensitivity to vibrations and air movement, or an acute sense of smell.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature’s vision determines how it is affected by obscured squares (see “Concealment". Unless otherwise noted, a creature has normal vision. Some creatures have special senses that are noted in their race entries or stat blocks. For example, a human typically has normal vision, whereas an elf has low-light vision.<br/><br/>Radius: If a creature has a special sense followed by a number, that number is the sense’s radius. Beyond that radius, a creature relies on its normal senses. For instance, if a creature has blindsight 6, the blindsight extends only 6 squares in every direction. If no radius is specified, the special sense extends as far as the creature can see.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 167.</p>
