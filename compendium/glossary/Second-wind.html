		<h1 class="player">Second wind</h1><p class="flavor">Adventurers can dig into their resolve and endurance to find an extra burst of vitality. In game terms, an adventurer focuses momentarily on self-defense and spends a healing surge to regain lost hit points. Using oneâ€™s second wind is the one way that all adventurers have of healing themselves during an encounter. They must otherwise rely on other sources of healing.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise noted in the stat block of a monster or DM-controlled character, this action is available only to adventurers.<br/><br/>Use Second Wind<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action: Standard action. A character can take this action only once per encounter, so he or she can take it again after a short or an extended rest. A character can use his or her second wind without taking an action if another character administers first aid to him or her using the Heal skill.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spend a Healing Surge: The character spends a healing surge to regain hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +2 Bonus to All Defenses: The character gains a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of his or her next turn. However, the character does not gain this bonus if he or she uses second wind as a result of someone administering first aid.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 291, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 248.</p>
