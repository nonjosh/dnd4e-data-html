		<h1 class="player">Grab</h1><p class="flavor">By using the grab power, any creature can try to seize a target bodily and keep it from moving. Although class powers and monster powers are usually more effective than grab at locking a target down, the advantage of grab is that anyone can use it, regardless of class.<br/><br/>GRAB: STANDARD ACTION<br/><br/>Target: You can attempt to grab a creature that is smaller than you, the same size category as you, or<br/>one category larger than you. The creature must be within your melee reach (don’t count extra reach<br/>from a weapon).<br/><br/>Strength Attack: Make a Strength attack vs. Reflex. Do not add any weapon modifiers. You must have at least one hand free to make a grab attempt. <br/>Hit: The enemy is immobilized until it escapes or you end the grab. Your enemy can attempt to escape on its turn.<br/><br/>Sustaining a Grab: You sustain a grab as a minor action. You can end a grab as a free action.<br/><br/>Effects that End a Grab: If you are affected by a condition that prevents you from taking opportunity actions (such as dazed, stunned, surprised, or unconscious), you immediately let go of a grabbed enemy. If you move away from the creature you’re grabbing, you let go and the grab ends. If a pull, a push, or a slide moves you or the creature you’re grabbing out of your reach, the grab ends.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 290, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 220, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 243.</p>
