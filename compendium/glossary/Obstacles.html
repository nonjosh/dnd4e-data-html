		<h1 class="player">Obstacles</h1><p class="flavor">Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement.<br/><br/>Obstacles Filling Squares: An obstacle such as a large tree, a pillar, or a floor-to-ceiling wall blocks a square entirely by completely filling it. You can’t  enter a square that is filled by an obstacle.<br/><br/>Corners:When an obstacle fills a square, you can’t move diagonally across the corner of that square.<br/><br/>Obstacles Between Squares: Some obstacles run along the edges of squares instead of through squares. An obstacle such as a low wall between two squares makes moving from one square to the other just like entering a square of difficult terrain, even if the squares on each side of the wall are not difficult.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 284, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 220.</p>
