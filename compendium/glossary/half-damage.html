		<h1 class="player">half damage</h1><p class="flavor">Some powers deal half damage when they miss, and some effects, such as the weakened condition, cause damage to be halved. When a power or other effect deals half damage, first apply all modifiers to the damage, including resistances and vulnerabilities, and then divide the damage in half (rounded down).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Albanon the wizard is weakened and uses ice storm, which deals 16 cold damage to a fire giant that has vulnerable 5 cold. First add 5 to the 16 cold damage for the vulnerability, giving a result of 21. Then divide that result in half for the weakened condition. The giant ends up taking 10 cold damage.<br/><br/>Insubstantial<br/>Some creatures, such as wraiths, are naturally insubstantial, and some powers can make a creature insubstantial. While a creature is insubstantial, it takes half damage from any attack that deals damage to it. Ongoing damage is also halved.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951017" target="_new">Monster Manual 2</a>, page(s) 217, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 220, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 226, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/283640000" target="_new">Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale</a>, page(s) 123.</p>
