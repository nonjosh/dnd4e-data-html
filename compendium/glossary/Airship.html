		<h1 class="player">Airship</h1><p class="flavor">This vessel floats above the ground, held aloft by a balloon filled with magic gas. The balloon sits within a wooden or metal frame, beneath which is a boat-shaped cabin that holds the crew, the passengers, and the cargo. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most airships are powered by a magic propeller, some resemble sailing ships and are driven by magically created winds. An airship requires a crew of five (in addition to the pilot) to fly effectively. Including the gas balloon, this vessel is 8 squares long, 4 squares wide, and 6 squares tall.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 20.</p>
