		<h1 class="player">NATURE (WISDOM)</h1><p><br/>The Nature skill encompasses knowledge and skills related to nature, including finding ways through wilderness, recognizing natural hazards, dealing with and identifying natural creatures, and living off the land. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in this skill represents formalized study or extensive experience. Those that have training in the skill are likely to know esoteric information in the field of study.</p><h3>NATURE KNOWLEDGE</h3>Make a Nature check to recall a relevant piece of lore about the natural world—terrain, climate, weather, plants, or seasons—or to recognize a nature-related clue (see “Knowledge Checks").<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of Nature knowledge include determining cardinal directions or finding a path (easy DC), recognizing a dangerous plant or another natural hazard (moderate DC), or predicting a coming change in the weather (moderate DC).<br/><h3>MONSTER KNOWLEDGE</h3>Make a Nature check to identify a creature that has the natural origin (see “Monster Knowledge Checks”).<br/><h3>FORAGE</h3>Make a Nature check to locate and gather food and water in the wilderness.<p class="flavor"><br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action: The check takes 1 hour of effort.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DC: DC 15 to find food and water for one person, or DC 25 for up to five people. The DM might adjust the DC in different environments: 5 lower in a cultivated environment or 5 higher in a barren one.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success: The creature finds enough food and water for 24 hours.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure: The creature finds no food or water. The creature must wait 24 hours to try again in the same area.</p><br/><h3>CALM ANIMAL</h3>Make a Nature check to calm a natural beast. For instance, a character might use this check to get a wild horse to let him or her ride it.<p class="flavor"><br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action: Standard action.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DC: Hard DC of the beast’s level. The check fails automatically against a beast that the character’s group is fighting.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success: The beast is calmed.</p><br/><h3>TRAIN ANIMAL</h3>Make a Nature check to teach a natural beast a simple trick (come, fetch, heel, stay, and so forth). This use of the skill is usually part of a skill challenge, which might take much longer than an encounter to complete.<br/><p class="flavor"><b></b><p class="flavor"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camouflage a trap or some other construction in a natural setting (opposed by Perception)<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build a shelter that provides some protection against harsh weather (moderate DC)</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 186, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247530000" target="_new">Rules Compendium</a>, page(s) 148.</p>
