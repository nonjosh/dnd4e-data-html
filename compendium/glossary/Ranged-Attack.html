		<h1 class="player">Ranged Attack</h1><p class="flavor">Targeted: Ranged attacks target individuals. A ranged attack against multiple enemies consists of separate attacks, each with its own attack roll and damage roll. Ranged attacks don’t create areas of effect.<br/>If you’re using a projectile weapon to make a ranged attack against multiple targets, you need one  piece of ammunition for each target, and if you’re using thrown weapons, you need one for each  target. <br/><br/>Range: Some powers set a specific range (“Ranged 10”) or allow you to attack any target you can see (“Ranged sight”). If you’re using a weapon, the attack’s range is the range of your weapon, as shown on the Ranged Weapons table in Chapter 7.<br/><br/>Long Range: If you use a ranged weapon and your target is farther away than the weapon’s normal range but within its long range, you take a -2 penalty to your attack roll. You can’t hit a target beyond the weapon’s long range. A ranged power that doesn’t use a weapon has a normal range but no long range.<br/><br/>Provoke Opportunity Attacks: If you use a ranged power while adjacent to an enemy, that enemy can make an opportunity attack against you.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 270.</p>
