In your ceaseless fight against the aberrant menace, you have focused on closing the breaches to the Far Realm where ancient safeguards have begun to fail. But your need to keep the world safe will exact a terrible price in the end.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>Using your soul’s power and your psionic abilities, you sacrifice yourself to strengthen the boundaries between the mortal realm and the madness of the Far Realm.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living Seal: To complete your task, you must recover the ancient Cerulean Seals, believed to have been lost or destroyed since the keepers of old faded from this world.

By working with these guardians, you merge your spiritual energy with their own and restore the wards they built.<br/><br/><h3>EIGHTH SEAL  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Keeper of the Cerulean Seals (21st level)</b>: As you embrace your destiny, the Seven Seals grant you the following benefit.<br/>* You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses.<br/>* When you hit an aberrant creature with an attack, the attack deals 2d12 extra psychic and radiant damage.<br/>* You are immune to fear effects.<br/>* You are considered an immortal creature for the purpose of effects that relate to creature origin.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Mind's Shining Corridors (24th level)</b>: When an enemy misses you with an attack against Will, it takes 2d12 psychic and radiant damage and is dazed until the end of your next turn.
