		<h1 class="player">Twilight Tribune</h1><p><i>You take on a ghostly aspect to more expertly do battle with the wayward spirits that haunt the cosmos.</i></p>All mortals have a dark road ahead of them in the afterlife. When their spirits are released from the flesh they were born into, they venture into the Shadowfell to make their way to the cold slopes of Letherna—and to whatever final destination awaits beyond the halls of the Raven Queen. However, some souls linger in the mortal realm, unable or unwilling to take this fateful journey. Entities such as ghosts, specters, wraiths, and devourers are the most dangerous of these hesitant spirits, committing atrocities through malicious intent or mindless despair.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to this scourge, the greatest and wisest heroes of the world are called by fate and the Raven Queen to serve as the Twilight Tribunes. These selfless champions dedicate their lives to seeking out and destroying wayward incorporeal souls. By invoking their dread judgment, the Twilight Tribunes allow even the most tormented undead to leave their lives and pain behind. As they follow the path of their destiny, the Twilight Tribunes are drawn to ever more powerful creatures and challenges, working their way through the most fearsome creatures of shadow and undeath. Having dispensed with liches, dracoliches, and vampires, a tribune might be called on in the end to face off against beings of godlike power and the greatest lords of the undead.<br/><br/>Living the Destiny<br/><br/>During your time as a Twilight Tribune, you might begin hearing whispers of an unspeakable evil lumbering its way back into existence. Could a slain god rise as an undead? Could Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, animate the corpse of dread Nerull as his servant, thus gaining enough power to challenge the gods directly?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of your journey, you might pass into the afterlife as all mortals do, or you might volunteer to stay behind as a ghostly judge—your unmatched wisdom continuing to guide mortal souls into the beyond. You might serve the Raven Queen as an advisor, or you might lead a covenant of tribunes that eventually replace her as the gods of fate and death.<br/><br/><h3>TWILIGHT TRIBUNE  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Twilight Insight (21st level)</b>: You increase your Wisdom score by 2.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you gain darkvision.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Twilight Cloak (24th level)</b>: When you use your second wind or use the total defense action, you can become insubstantial until the end of your next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tribune's Authority (26th level)</b>: You gain the tribune’s authority power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tribune's Judgment (30th level)</b>: Whenever a nonminion enemy hits you with a melee attack, roll a d20.
