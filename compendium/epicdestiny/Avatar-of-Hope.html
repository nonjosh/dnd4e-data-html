		<h1 class="player">Avatar of Hope</h1><p><i>You steadfastly believe that hope lifts up everyone even in the darkest times. By word and deed, you spread hope wherever you go.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, Hope Remains feat<br/><br/>As an avatar of hope, you are an aspect of a god of hope who has chosen to incarnate himself or herself in a mortal body for a time. You now know that you are both your deity and your own mortal shell at the same time. When you speak, when you act, your god speaks and acts through you. No matter what your name, you are a beacon of hope in a dark world.<br/><br/>Sorrow cannot abide your presence; you bring optimism and virtue to places of despair and sadness. You are an enemy of all the gods of evil, for they are destroyers of hope. You hold particular vehemence toward devils and demons—devils for their malicious practices, and demons for their recklessly destructive intentions. It’s true that you’ve seen some terrible sights during your travels—murder, cruelty, slavery, war—but these horrors only fortify your determination. By your power, the points of light that lie within a sea of darkness burn a little brighter for a time.<br/><br/>Immortality<br/>You have fought battles against despair all your life, bringing light to the darkest corners of the world. Your experience has taught you that people need only a little inspiration to find hope, so you have set yourself the task of providing an example, a legend, that will inspire people for ages to come.<br/>Divine Reunion: When you complete your Destiny Quest, your soul bursts forth in a golden flame that consumes your mortal form, and you are reunited with your immortal self.<br/><br/><h3>AVATAR OF HOPE  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Indomitable Courage (21st level)</b>: You are immune to fear effects. In addition, you and any allies within 5 squares of you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Undaunted Will (21st level)</b>: Your Wisdom score and your Charisma score both increase by 2.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hopeful Revival (24th level)</b>: The first time each day you begin your turn dying or dead, you revive.
