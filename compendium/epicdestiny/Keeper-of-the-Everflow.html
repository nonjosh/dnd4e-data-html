		<h1 class="player">Keeper of the Everflow</h1><p><i>You draw on the power of the Spirit Wheel, fundamentally changing your physical and spiritual nature to adapt to any challenge you face.</i></p>A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen’s domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp.<br/><br/>Living the Destiny<br/><br/>As you achieve enlightenment, your actions attract the attention of beings that would rather face eternal destruction than abide a change in the everflow.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost among these opponents are the servants of the Raven Queen. Her legions of shadar-kai and sorrowsworn hunt you unceasingly, but their wrath is only a foreshadowing of the eventual confrontation between you and the god of death. When that final conflict comes, you will lead the Raven Queen back into the everflow—by force if necessary—so that she might be reborn and attain the enlightenment she has denied herself and all other creatures.<br/><br/><h3>KEEPER OF THE EVERFLOW  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Enlightened Rebirth (21st level)</b>: You increase one ability score of your choice by 2.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you can change your origin at the end of a short rest or an extended rest.
