		<h1 class="player">Eternal Defender</h1><p><i>You stand in the path of those who would rend the defenseless world. That world is safe behind your ever-vigilant shield.</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, fighter<br/><br/>You have taken the defender ideal to heart. This devotion might have started at childhood, when you stood up for those weaker than you. Perhaps the ideal of the mighty protecting the weak was culturally instilled in you, as it is in all good-hearted dwarves. Whatever the case, rather than using your strength and power solely for personal gain, you willingly placed yourself in harm’s way to make sure that others had a chance to survive and thrive.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core of your personal morals and beliefs is the certainty that it is your job to protect your allies. When among them, you stand in the forefront in times of danger, no matter how dire the foe. Your skill and courage ever prove an anchor for your companions during the tumult of battle.<br/><br/>Immortality?<br/>Bravery and immovability define you as a champion to your friends and the people you have saved over the course of your chronicle. To many, you are the mountain holding back the onrush of a monstrous tide.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everlasting Bulwark: You have laid low your final and greatest adversary. During the fight you, as always, formed the steady center around which your allies could operate, taking the brunt of the punishment without bending or complaining. Ever more will you be the supreme standard for those on the front line of any battle.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world always needs someone of your strength and stature at the ready to come to its defense. Those wishing to take up sword or hammer to defend others refer to you as if you were a saint. Although your name might be spoken as a universally recognized synonym for the ultimate guardian, you’re not ready to just lay down your shield and axe.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, then, you take a place in divine dominions, next to or in service to a godly stalwart such as Moradin. Building a post somewhere in the cosmos, you might take it upon yourself to stand vigil over a primordial threat or against the machinations of evil deities. If something stirs or threatens, you herald the coming danger and stand the first to face it. Perhaps instead some power helps you eternally watch over a chosen people, infusing your watchful spirit into the land. Or you might make a pact to pass away but instill your defender’s heart into your folk, awakening a new profusion of heroes.<br/><br/><h3>ETERNAL DEFENDER  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unending Strength (21st level)</b>: Increase your Strength score by 2.
