		<h1 class="player">Sage of the Swan Tower</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>21st level, must worship Ioun<br/><br/>Your ceaseless drive to learn and your devotion to Ioun has enabled you to attain a status few others can claim. As a Sage of the Swan Tower, you have gained access to the glorious Halls of Enlightenment and can call upon its infinite knowledge. You, however, are not like the other sages. You find the traditional method of learning through reading to be insufficient and spend much of your time in the field, acquiring new knowledge and testing theories.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each new nugget of information—each new revelation—brings you closer to the goal that you have held in your heart for so long. You feel the call of Ioun as you achieve greater feats of discovery and demystify new layers of knowledge. Eventually your dream becomes reality, and you are invited to become one of the timeless sages of the Swan Tower.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life among your fellow sages in Kerith-Ald is all you hoped it would be, yet you see more potential for yourself every time you visit the Pillars of Ioun. It has been a long time since Ioun has honored one of her sages in such a way. Perhaps with some perseverance you can come to deserve your own alabaster monument.<br/><br/><h3>SAGE OF THE SWAN TOWER  FEATURES</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Expert in Your Field (21st level)</b>: Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 2.
