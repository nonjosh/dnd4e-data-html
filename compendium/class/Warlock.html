They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However you came to your arcane knowledge, you need not accept the poor reputation warlocks sometimes endure. You could be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, you could be a true diabolist using your gifts to tyrannize the weak—some warlocks unfortunately are exactly that.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pacts are complete. The rites have concluded. The signs are drawn in blood, and the seals are broken. Your destiny beckons.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A WARLOCK</H3>The two basic builds of warlock are the deceptive warlock and the scourge warlock. Warlocks rely on Charisma, Constitution, and Intelligence. No warlock powers or class features depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom.<br/><h3>DECEPTIVE WARLOCK</h3>You prefer spells that deal a little less damage, but that inflict a variety of penalties and negative conditions on your foe. You’d rather fight at range and avoid getting caught in close-up battles. Most of your attack powers depend on Charisma, so that should be your best score. Many of your powers receive a bonus if you have a good Intelligence score, so that should be your second-best score. Constitution should be your third choice since you might want to choose some Constitution-based powers. You need it for a good Fortitude defense anyway.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceptive warlocks should choose the fey pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Misty Step (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, eyebite</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>witchfire</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>curse of the dark dream</i><br/><br/><h3>SCOURGE WARLOCK</h3>No subtlety here—you want to deal damage. You’re tougher than the deceptive warlock, and you’ve got powers to help you attack and defend in melee, as well as excellent ranged attacks. Your best attack powers depend on Constitution—make that your best ability score. Choose Intelligence second because it provides special bonuses to many of your powers and improves your Reflex defense and AC, too. Charisma is clearly your third choice.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scourge warlocks should choose the infernal pact or the star pact (see “Class Features”).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Dark One’s Blessing (Human feat: Action Surge)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, History, Intimidate, Streetwise<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hellish rebuke</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>vampiric embrace</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flames of Phlegethos</i><br/><br/><h3>SORCERER-KING PACT</h3>On Athas, many templars swear an oath to a sorcerer-king in exchange for arcane power. The sorcerer-king pact reflects the training and magical transformations that a sorcerer-king might provide to an individual whom he or she deems worthy. A warlock who has this pact can draw on the reserves of power that a sorcerer-king commands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most warlocks of this pact are templars in a sorcerer-king’s service. They are often trusted members of the templar hierarchy who are expected to command the soldiers, the agents, or the underlings of a sorcerer-king. Thus, the powers of the sorcererking pact aid allies and work well in melee. A sorcerer-king sometimes imparts his or her power to a promising protégé or a privileged noble without making the recipient into a templar, although such instances are unusual.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer-kings desire servants who have great stamina and force of personality, so Charisma or Constitution should be the primary ability score for someone who has this pact. Intelligence is best as your secondary ability score, because many sorcerer-king pact powers gain a benefit from it. Charisma or Constitution, whichever you didn’t pick as a primary score, is a good third choice. Choose Charisma to bolster your low Will defense if you plan to remain at range, or else use Constitution to gain extra hit points and healing surges if you intend to use your powers in melee combat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Sorcerer-king pact<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Scornful Denial<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Bluff, Insight, Streetwise<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>eldritch blast, hand of blight</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>cruel bounty</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>ashen scourge</i><br/><br/><h3>WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>ELDRITCH BLAST</b><br/>All warlocks know the eldritch blast at-will power. This power can be used as a basic attack. You gain this power as well as another at-will power as determined by your Eldritch Pact.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Warlock Attack 1</span>Eldritch Blast</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You fire a bolt of dark, crackling eldritch energy at your foe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Charisma or Constitution vs. Reflex</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier damage.<br/>Increase damage to 2d10 + Charisma modifier or Constitution modifier at 21st level.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: At 1st level, you determine whether you use Charisma or Constitution to attack with this power.

When a power allows you to make a ranged basic attack, you can use this power.</p><br/>Update (8/11/2011)<br/>Updated in Class Compendium.<br/><br/></p><b>ELDRITCH PACT</b><br/>You have forged a pact with mysterious entities that grant you your arcane powers. Choose one pact. The pacts presented in the Player’s Handbook are the fey pact, the infernal pact, and the star pact. Other products present additional pacts. The pact you choose determines the following warlock abilities:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At-Will Spells: Your pact determines one of the at-will spells you know.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pact Boon: Each pact includes a pact boon. The pact boon is a granted power you can use to further hex your enemies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pact you take also provides bonuses to certain warlock powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Eldritch Pact selection has on them.<br/><br/><b>Dark Pact</b><br/>You have forged a pact with the dark beings that lurk in the shadows of the drow civilization. Spells of darkness, poison, madness, and spite fill your mind. You might turn your powers to noble ends, but you always face the temptation to enhance your spells by hurting your friends—just a little. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiteful Glamor: You know the spiteful glamor at-will spell.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkspiral Aura: You have the Darkspiral Aura pact boon. As your cursed enemies fall in battle, your  Darkspiral Aura grows in power. You can unleash it on an enemy, blasting its mind and body.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an enemy under your Warlock’s Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, add 1 to your Darkspiral Aura. Your Darkspiral Aura has a starting value of 0, and it resets to 0 when you take a short rest or an extended rest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an enemy makes a melee attack or a ranged attack against you, you can use your Darkspiral Aura as an immediate interrupt, dealing 1d6 necrotic and psychic damage to that enemy for each point of your Darkspiral Aura’s current value. If this attack deals less than 12 damage, the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 0. If this attack deals 12 damage or more, you can cause the enemy to be weakened for its attack (which means the attack deals half damage), and the value of your Darkspiral Aura becomes 1.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11th level, the damage you deal increases to 1d8 per point of your Darkspiral Aura’s current value, and at 21st level the damage increases to 1d10 per point of your Darkspiral Aura’s current value. <br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Warlock Pact Boon 1</span>Darkspiral Aura</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your cursed enemies fall in battle, your Darkspiral Aura grows in power.

These remnants are diverse in their backgrounds and motives. As a vestige pact warlock, you can choose from between two or more vestige pacts to fuel your arcane power.<br/>Eyes of the Vestige: You know the eyes of the vestige spell. You gain an additional effect, referred to as an eyes of the vestige augment, associated with your active vestige (see below) when you make a successful attack with this power.<br/>Pact Boon: You have a pact boon associated with your active vestige.<br/>When an enemy under your Warlock’s Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain the benefit of your active vestige’s pact boon.<br/><br/>Using Vestiges<br/>You always have one active vestige. As a beginning character, you have access to the two primary vestiges: King Elidyr and Zutwa. You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest.<br/>Changing Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don’t immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power.<br/>After a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige.

A warlock wielding a magic rod or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. Without a rod or a wand, a warlock can still use these powers, but he or she doesn’t gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pact blade, a special magic dagger, can also be used as an implement for warlock powers, as well as warlock paragon powers. These daggers are highly sought after by warlocks.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 129, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd" target="_new">Class Compendium</a>.</p>
