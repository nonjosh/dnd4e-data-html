		<h1 class="player">Artificer</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. You channel arcane power into items that empower your allies and hinder your enemies. You lean toward controller as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. The cryptic formulas of arcane magic and the complex recipes of alchemy appeal to you. You are especially knowledgeable about magic items.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence, Constitution, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Rods, staffs, wands<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level.<br/><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Perception (Wis), Thievery (Dex).<br/><br/><b>Build Options: </b>Battlesmith Artificer, Tinkerer Artificer, Warrior Forge Artificer.<br/><b>Class features: </b>Arcane Empowerment, Arcane Rejuvenation, Healing Infusion, Ritual Casting.<br/></blockquote></p>Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. <br/><br/>As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. <br/><br/>With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A ARTIFICER</H3>Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items.<br/><h3>BATTLESMITH ARTIFICER</h3>You weave strands of magic and thread them into items and allies. With these infusions, weapons become stronger, armor becomes tougher, and allies become more durable. You should make Intelligence your highest ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your attack powers. Constitution helps augment your spells’ damage and defense boosts, so it should be your second highest ability. A good Wisdom score can help bolster your Will and support any powers you take outside your specialty.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception,Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>aggravating force, static shock</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>burning weapons</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>icebound sigil</i><br/><br/><h3>TINKERER ARTIFICER</h3>Using whatever materials are on hand, you empower weapons and armors and even create allies. You imbue each of your creations with magic, elemental spirits, and a spark of life, giving it the power to perform a specific task. Your attack powers are based on Intelligence, so it should be your primary ability score. Your second-best ability score should be Wisdom, which enhances the artifices and the constructs you create. Other artificer powers rely on Constitution, so that should be your third highest ability score.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Alchemy<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, History, Perception, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>magic weapon, thundering armor</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>spike wire</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>obedient servant</i><br/><br/><h3>WARRIOR FORGE ARTIFICER</h3>The warrior forge artificer fights from a distance, using implement and ranged weapon attacks to deliver punishment away from the front lines. The warrior forge artificer turns his allies into his weapons, while at the same time providing them with defensive bonuses so that they can stand up to the increased punishment that comes with having one less character in melee combat. Assign your highest ability score to Intelligence, and your second highest to Wisdom. The build offers a path of powers for implement users, as well as one for weapon users, but you can mix and match if you so choose.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>flameburst armor</i><br/><br/><h3>ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>You have the following class features.<br/><br/><b>ARCANE EMPOWERMENT</b><br/>Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.<br/><br/><b>Augment Energy</b><br/>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way.<br/><br/><b>Impart Energy</b><br/>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way.<br/><br/><b>ARCANE REJUVENATION</b><br/>Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies’ magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer’s allies uses a magic item’s daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.<br/><br/><b>HEALING INFUSION</b><br/>You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.<br/><br/>You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended.<br/><br/>When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Artificer Feature </span>Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You use the magic of your infusion to heal the wounds of your target.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature.<br/>Level 6: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 2.<br/>Level 11: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 4.<br/>Level 16: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 6.<br/>Level 21: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 8.<br/>Level 26: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 10.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round.

In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components.<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.<br/><br/>Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a  ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power’s effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 44.</p>
