This tactic denies the defensive benefit of a shield, but allows a scout to strike hard and fast. At their best when outnumbered and surrounded, scouts count on speed and accuracy in combat to overwhelm their foes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scouts augment their combat prowess with primal magic, channeling the supernatural power of the natural world to their advantage. Primal power allows a scout to pass by foes unseen, to discourage pursuit, and to keep his or her companions alive in the wild under conditions that would slay lesser explorers outright.<br/><br/><h3>RANGER (SCOUT) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ASPECTS OF THE WILD (SCOUT)</b><br/>You gain two of the following powers of your choice.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Ranger Utility </span>Aspect of the Charging Ram</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You barrel past your foes with such speed and strength that they are unable to react to your assault.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Stance</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You assume a stance, the aspect of the charging ram.
