These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered  and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture’s entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the  fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller.<br/><br/><h3>BARD (SKALD) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>DECEPTIVE DUELIST</b><br/>When you make a melee basic attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br/><br/><b>MASTER OF STORY AND SONG</b><br/>You gain two 1st-level bard daily attack powers of your choice, but each day you can use only one bard daily attack power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you gain a bard daily attack power at 5th level, you can use two bard daily attack powers per day, but no more than one of a particular level. Similarly, after you gain a bard daily attack power at 9th level, you can use three bard daily attack powers per day, but still no more than one of a particular level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At level 15, 19, 25, and 29, you gain a bard daily attack power of your level or lower without having to replace a power, but the number that you can use per day remains at three.<br/><br/><b>SKALD’S AURA</b><br/>You gain the skald’s aura power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bard Utility </span>Skald’s Aura</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You chant, sing, or otherwise inspire your allies with your words, allowing them to draw the strength to battle on from your encouragement.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Aura</b>, <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 5 that lasts until the end of the encounter.

A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time.<br/><br/><b>WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP</b><br/>You gain the words of friendship power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bard Feature </span>Words of Friendship</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You infuse your words with arcane power, turning even the simplest speech into a compelling oration.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Charm</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 55.</p>
