		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Battlemind</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Constitution, Wisdom, Charisma<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale; heavy shields, light shields.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 7.5+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 3<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 4.5<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Psionic Augmentation (Hybrid), Psionic Defense (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Battlemind Armor Proficiency, Psionic Study (Hybrid).<br/></blockquote></p>When you start with a sturdy mind and body, you can add almost any other set of talents to achieve a strong whole—or so you like to tell yourself.<br/><br/>What led you to add another class’s abilities to your own mental and physical perfection as a battlemind? Do you secretly believe your psionic talents to be unreliable, at least compared to a strong blade or a reliance on other forms of magic? Or have you only recently discovered your psionic capabilities?<br/><br/>As a hybrid battlemind, you give up some battlefield control and psionic tricks in order to add another class’s features and powers to your arsenal.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the class feature, except that your power point total varies depending on your selection of powers. See “Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters” in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have.<br/><br/><b>PSIONIC DEFENSE (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the battlemind class feature, except that you must choose either blurred step or mind spike.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>BATTLEMIND ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, light shields, and heavy shields.<br/><br/><b>PSIONIC STUDY (HYBRID)</b><br/>Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.<br/>Choose one of these options.<br/><br/><b>Battle Resilience (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Battle Resilience</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You steel yourself for battle, girding yourself against your foe’s initial assault.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/>Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/>Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Speed of Thought (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Speed of Thought</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You move in the blink of an eye, reaching your foes before they can draw their weapons.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You roll initiative</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power even if you’re surprised.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Wild Focus (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/>The battlemind/fighter has plenty of durability, but you’ll need to assign high scores to both Strength and Constitution, with Wisdom as your third-best score.<br/><br/>The ardent/battlemind also needs two high scores—Constitution and Charisma—but can manage without a third good score. This combination also gives you the full array of power points for your augmentable powers.<br/><br/>A battlemind/warlock can get away with only one high ability score (Constitution), and Charisma makes a great secondary score for both classes. Unfortunately, you’re a little fragile for a defender, so either shore up those defenses or find a tough ally to stand next to.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 142.</p>
