		<h1 class="player">Ranger</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. You concentrate on either ranged attacks or two-weapon melee fighting to deal a lot of damage to one enemy at a time. Your attacks rely on speed and mobility, since you prefer to use hit-and-run tactics whenever possible.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Martial. Your talents depend on extensive training and practice, inner confidence, and natural proficiency.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: Dungeoneering or Nature (your choice).

Masters of bow and blade, rangers excel at hit-and-run assaults and can quickly and silently eliminate foes. Rangers lay superb ambushes and excel at avoiding danger.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a ranger, you possess almost supernaturally keen senses and a deep appreciation for untamed wilderness. With your knowledge of the natural world, you are able to track enemies through nearly any landscape, using the smallest clue to set your course, even sometimes the calls and songs of beasts and birds. Your severe demeanor promises a deadly conclusion to any enemy you hunt.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you catch sight of your quarry, will the transgressor perish by swift bow shots from a distance, or by the twofold blades that glint and glitter in each of your battle-scarred hands?<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A RANGER</H3>Rangers depend on Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom for most of their powers. Constitution is also useful, since it helps them stand up to damage. The three ranger builds presented here are the archer ranger, the beastmaster ranger and the melee ranger.<br/><h3>ARCHER RANGER</h3>You are a master of the bow (or, rarely, the crossbow, sling, or thrown weapon). You prefer ranged attack powers, and you resort to melee only when there are no good targets left for your arrows. Most of your attack powers use Dexterity, so Dexterity should be your highest ability score. You find yourself in melee from time to time, so Strength is a good choice for your second-highest score. Wisdom should be your third-best ability score. Choose powers that reflect your preference for ranged weapons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>careful attack, nimble strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>evasive strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>split the tree</i><br/><br/><h3>BEASTMASTER RANGER</h3>A deadly hunter, you specialize in double-teaming your enemies with the aid of a beast companion. Your beast is an extension of you, and thereby it is an invaluable member of your group. No other is needed to help you flank your quarry. Melee combat with the aid of your beast is your focus, so you favor Strength. You count on Dexterity for your AC and occasional ranged attacks, so your secondary focus is on that ability score. Wisdom, your tertiary ability score, makes you better at the Perception skill and gives you an edge with many ranger powers. The Beast Mastery class feature is designed to complement this build.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Improved Initiative)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>circling strike, predator strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>synchronized strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>partnered savaging</i><br/><br/><h3>HUNTER RANGER</h3>Stealthy and agile, you are a talented skirmisher who adapts to overcome any combat scenario. Although you resemble the archer ranger, your powers provide you with mobility and more melee options. You are unrivaled in your ability to fight well at any range.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Hunter Fighting Style, Running Attack<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Nature, Perception, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>fading strike, twin strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>skirmish shot</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>skirmishing stance</i><br/><br/><h3>MARAUDER RANGER</h3>Fierce, fast, and hard-hitting, you are skilled at fighting with two weapons and using your off hand for throwing or parrying. Many of your attacks require thrown weapons. You’re faster than other characters, but you’re not interested in outrunning trouble; you go looking for it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scything blow</i><br/><br/><h3>TWO-BLADE RANGER</h3>You like to get up close and rely on the ranger’s famous two-weapon fighting style. Naturally, you prefer melee attack powers, and that means Strength should be your highest ability score. For your second ability, Dexterity is a good choice because it improves your AC. Make Wisdom your third choice, since it adds to your Will defense and provides a bonus to many of your powers. Choose powers that reflect your preference for fighting with two melee weapons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lethal Hunter (Human feat: Action Surge)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Dungeoneering, Endurance, Heal, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>hit and run, twin strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>dire wolverine strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>jaws of the wolf</i><br/><br/><h3>RANGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Your class features depend largely on the build and fighting style you choose.<br/><br/><b>FIGHTING STYLE</b><br/>Choose one of the following fighting styles and gain its benefit: Archer Fighting Style, Beast Mastery, Two-Blade Fighting Style, Marauder Fighting Style, Hunter Fighting Style.<br/><br/><b>Archer Fighting Style</b><br/>Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat.<br/><br/><b>Beast Mastery</b><br/>The Beast Mastery class feature is available to any ranger who wishes to gain a loyal beast companion. To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style.<br/>You gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&D world. You decide the creature’s relevant details— its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion’s species doesn’t affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beast Mastery also alters your Hunter’s Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter’s Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter’s Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander’s strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn’t a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals.<br/><br/><b>Hunter Fighting Style</b><br/>You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack.<br/><br/><b>Marauder Fighting Style</b><br/>You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren’t using a shield or a two-handed weapon.<br/><br/><b>Two-Blade Fighting Style</b><br/>Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<br/><br/><b>HUNTER'S QUARRY</b><br/>Once per turn, you can use your Hunter's Quarry power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Hunter's Quarry  Power</span>Hunter's Quarry</h1><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry.<br/>Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level. If you can make multiple attacks in a round, you decide which attack to apply the extra damage to after all the attacks are rolled. If you have dealt Hunter’s Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>The hunter’s quarry effect remains active until the end of the encounter, until the quarry is defeated, or until you designate a different target as your quarry.<br/><br/>You can designate one enemy as your quarry at a time.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Hunter’s Quarry Extra Damage</th></tr><tr><td>1st–10th</td><td>+1d6</td></tr><tr><td>11th–20th</td><td>+2d6</td></tr><tr><td>21st–30th</td><td>+3d6</td></tr></table></p><br/>Addition (10/17/2008)<br/>Add the following sentence at the end of the second paragraph: “If you have dealt Hunter’s Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn.”<br/><br/>Revision (7/16/2008)<br/>Replace the first sentence of the second paragraph with the following: “Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level.”<br/><br/>Revision (6/10/2008)<br/>In the first paragraph, replace “enemy nearest to you” with “nearest enemy to you that you can see.”<br/><br/></p><b>PRIME SHOT</b><br/>If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style.<br/><br/><b>RUNNING ATTACK</b><br/>This class feature replaces the Prime Shot class feature.<br/><br/>If you use a standard action that lets you move (such as a charge or the skirmish shot power), and you end that movement at least 2 squares away from where you began that move, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made as part of that standard action.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 103.</p>
