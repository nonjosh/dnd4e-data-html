What keeps you from fully embracing the pacts of a warlock? Do you fear the price that such bargains might entail? Or have you not yet managed to pin down the final secret that would unleash your arcane destiny? As a hybrid warlock, you command excellent damage-dealing ability along with some control powers, but you must give up some of the more notable features of the class, including the Pact Boon and Shadow Walk.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID WARLOCK CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>ELDRITCH PACT (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you don’t gain the at-will attack power or the Pact Boon granted by it. This means you meet prerequisites that require the pact you choose, and you can use the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br/><br/><b>WARLOCK'S CURSE (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit a cursed enemy with a warlock power or a warlock paragon path power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Warlock's Curse  Power</span>Warlock's Curse</h1><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a Warlock’s Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. If you hit a cursed enemy with an attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Warlock’s Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can place a Warlock’s Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can’t place a Warlock’s Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or another character’s Warlock’s Curse.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you advance in level, your extra damage increases.<br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Warlock’s Curse Extra Damage</th></tr><tr><td>1st–10th</td><td>+1d6</td></tr><tr><td>11th–20th</td><td>+2d6</td></tr><tr><td>21st–30th</td><td>+3d6</td></tr></table></p><br/>Update (8/23/2011)<br/>Updated in Class Compendium.<br/><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>PRIME SHOT</b><br/>If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style.<br/><br/><b>SHADOW WALK</b><br/>On your turn, if you move at least 3 squares away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of your next turn.<br/><br/><b>WARLOCK PACT BOON</b><br/>You gain the Pact Boon associated with your Eldritch Pact.<br/>To select this option, you must have selected the at-will attack power associated with your pact. If you later retrain that power, you lose the benefit of this option.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score.<br/><br/>Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard’s key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock.<br/><br/>A combination of warlock and bard works quite well, thanks to the ability score overlap of the two classes and the diversity of their power selection.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 153.</p>
