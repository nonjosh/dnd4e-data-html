		<h1 class="player">Invoker</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Controller. You invoke the power of a god to blast your foes from a distance, leave them unable to defend themselves, and scatter them to the four winds. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either leader or striker as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Divine. You practice an ancient form of divine magic, wielding the power that the gods themselves used in their battle against the primordials.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Wisdom, Constitution, Intelligence<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Rods, staffs<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 10+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 4<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level.<br/><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int).<br/><br/><b>Build Options: </b>Malediction Invoker, Preserving Invoker, Wrathful Invoker.<br/><b>Class features: </b>Channel Divinity, Divine Covenant, Ritual Casting.<br/></blockquote></p>At the dawn of time, the gods who inhabited the Astral Sea warred with the primordials of the Elemental Chaos, the mighty beings who shaped the world out of formless void. The greatest of the gods' mortal agents in that war were invokers, imbued with a fragment of the gods' own might to fight alongside them. No other mortal servant of the gods can claim the same kind of power. Through rites of investiture, avengers, clerics, and paladins gain the ability to manifest echoes of that power, uttering careful prayers and channeling divine energy through their holy symbols. You, however, channel your god's power directly. No mere symbol can contain it, for you speak the words of creation, shaping the universe to your and your god's will.<br/><br/>Perhaps you were trained in a secret monastery, or you studied in a library where the universe's oldest lore was preserved. Or perhaps you experienced the presence of your god firsthand and took a shard of divine power into yourself. You might even be an immortal born into flesh, slowly awakening to the awesome divine power that is your birthright. Whatever your past, you are among the gods' most trusted servants, bound to a covenant in which you swore to use divine power with great care. To what end will you wield that might?<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A INVOKER</H3>Invokers rely on Wisdom -- as an expression of their link to the divine will -- for the accuracy and potency of their attacks. Each invoker enters into a covenant with a god, a sworn pact in which the invoker agrees to fulfill certain duties in exchange for the divine power he or she will use to carry out those duties. The two most common covenants -- the Covenant of Preservation and the Covenant of Wrath -- lend themselves to two common invoker builds. Even though you must choose a covenant, you can choose any powers you like to help you fulfill it.<br/><h3>MALEDICTION INVOKER</h3>The malediction invoker build is based on the Covenant of Malediction. The malediction invoker employs dread words of power to eradicate the gods’ foes. These words of power come from the gods’ lexicon, the very words of creation. The words are frequently too potent for mortals, imperiling the health and sanity of those who speak them. Malediction invokers need a high Wisdom score to intone the words properly and to piece together the inflections and holy grammar required to use the words in battle. Words of power bear a physical price, so malediction invokers should consider making Constitution their second highest ability, followed closely by Intelligence.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Malediction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Baleful Malediction<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Insight, Religion<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping shards, visions of blood</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>summons of justice</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>execration</i><br/><br/><h3>PRESERVING INVOKER</h3>You defend your allies, combining defensive magic with prayers that hinder or prevent your enemies' attacks. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence, since you need foresight and cunning to protect your allies. Choose powers that grant defensive benefits to your allies or penalties to your enemies. The preserving invoker leans toward leader as a secondary role.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Preservation<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Insightful Preservation<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Religion<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>sun strike, vanguard's lightning</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>blades of astral fire</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>binding invocation of chains</i><br/><br/><h3>WRATHFUL INVOKER</h3>You are an instrument of divine wrath, smiting those who have the temerity to doubt the reach of your god's power. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, since your physical durability allows you to withstand and channel divine wrath. Focus on powers that bring ruin to your foes. The wrathful invoker leans toward striker as a secondary role.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Covenant of Wrath<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invoker Defense<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Insight, Intimidate, Religion<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>avenging light, grasping shards</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>thunder of judgment</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>purging flame</i><br/><br/><h3>INVOKER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Invokers have the following class features.<br/><br/><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br/>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br/><br/><b>DIVINE COVENANT</b><br/>Invokers wield ancient divine power that is not accessible to most mortals -- only to those who enter into a personal covenant with a god. Invokers undergo long years of study and testing. Only after that time are they allowed to enter into the final covenant that grants them access to this class's powers. Some say that, in the final swearing of the covenant, the invoker's god briefly manifests, but the details of an invoker's initiation are a closely held secret.<br/>Choose one of the options described below. The Divine Covenant you choose provides you with a Channel Divinity power and a covenant manifestation that takes effect whenever you use a divine encounter or daily attack power. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain invoker powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Covenant of Malediction</b><br/>The gods entrust you with the invocations of destruction used in their war against the primordials, so you can carry forward their sacred cause and ensure that the world’s enemies never rise again.<br/><br/>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power maledictor’s doom.<br/><br/>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can push one target hit by the power 1 square after the power’s effect is resolved.<br/><br/><b>Covenant of Preservation</b><br/>The gods have charged you to defend the faithful and to ally with those who seek to defeat the gods' enemies.<br/>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power preserver's rebuke.<br/>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you can slide an ally within 10 squares of you 1 square.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Covenant of Preservation  Power</span>Preserver's Rebuke</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call upon the gods to punish the enemy that dares harm those entrusted to your care.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Channel Divinity</b>: You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 10 squares of you hits your ally </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Before the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your next attack roll against the triggering enemy equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><br/></p><br/><b>Covenant of Wrath</b><br/>You have sworn to seek out and destroy those that oppose the gods. Primordials, demons, and devils fall before your magic like wheat before a scythe.<br/>Channel Divinity: You gain the Channel Divinity power armor of wrath.<br/>Covenant Manifestation: When you use a divine encounter or daily attack power on your turn, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to 1 for each enemy you attack with the power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Covenant of Wrath  Power</span>Armor of Wrath</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your foe strikes, you invoke the gods' power to encase yourself in a burning aura of radiant energy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Channel Divinity</b>: You can use only one channel divinity power per encounter.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy within 5 squares of you hits you</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target takes radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier, and you push the target 2 squares.<br/>Level 11: 1d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage.<br/>Level 21: 2d6 + Constitution modifier radiant damage.</p><br/></p><br/><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br/>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br/><br/>INVOKERS AND RITUALS<br/>You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: Hand of Fate and one 1st-level ritual.<br/>Once per day, you can use Hand of Fate without expending components.<br/><br/>INVOKERS AND DEITIES<br/>Choice of Deity: Like other divine characters, invokers are dedicated servants of one or more deities. Most invokers devote themselves to a single deity, but all invokers recognize the entire pantheon as worthy of respect (see "Deities," Player's Handbook, page 20). Whereas a cleric might revere Corellon and despise Lolth as a rival and enemy, an invoker dedicated to Corellon recognizes Lolth and her servants as comrades in arms against the forces that seek to destroy the world and the gods. That's not to say that you can't oppose the evil schemes of Lolth's followers if you're dedicated to Corellon, only that you shouldn't lose sight of the grander scheme of things.<br/><br/>Choice of Alignment: Invokers don't gain their power through rites of investiture or ordination, as avengers, clerics, and paladins do. You bear the touch of your god's own hand on your soul, a direct channel through which divine power can flow into the world, shaped by your will. Because you strive to bring your will into perfect accordance with your deity's, your alignment must match your deity's. For instance, an invoker of Moradin must be lawful good, an invoker of Pelor must be good, and an invoker of Ioun must be unaligned.<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Invokers do not make use of holy symbols, since they believe that their magic predates and transcends such representations of divine power. Instead, invokers make use of rods and staffs as representations of the gods' dominion over the world. When you wield a magic rod or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of invoker powers and invoker paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 100.</p>
