		<h1 class="player">Swordmage</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender. You are a melee combatant who uses spells to fight better.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane.

The combat skills they possess are enhanced by the magic they wield. The flourish of a swordmage’s blade not only bites with steel, but also with fire, lightning, or other powerful forces.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You studied and practiced for years to master your skills. You mastered the fundamentals of arcane magic and combined this academic study with endless hours of physical training. You might be a young eladrin in search of your fortune, a stranger to the wider world outside the seclusion of your homeland; a self-trained genasi sellsword, gifted with an affinity for elemental magic; the scion of a disgraced noble human family, taught by the finest tutors in your youth but now a footloose expatriate; or a half-elf arcane champion, rigorously trained in a war magic academy to serve in the armies of your homeland.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical barriers of force swirl around you, protecting you from harm. The blade you carry is an extension of your being, both body and mind. It pulses with eldritch energy as you prepare to defend your allies and unleash magical fury against your foes.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</H3>The swordmage has two builds: assault swordmage and shielding swordmage. Intelligence plays into all your attacks, but you might emphasize either Strength or Constitution for added benefits.<br/><h3>ASSAULT SWORDMAGE</h3>Your style of combat focuses on flashy attacks that call up elemental forces and throw your opponents around the battlefield. This method of aggressive swordmage combat spread from Returned Abeir to Toril through the heritage of the anarchs of Shyr. Your attacks use Intelligence, so that should be your primary ability score. Strength should be your second-best ability score, since it enhances your assault powers and keeps your base attack bonus high. Constitution helps your survivability and can be useful if you want to try some shielding swordmage powers. Most assault swordmages use a two-handed weapon (such as a greatsword or a falchion) to deal more damage, though they have a lower AC as a result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Escalating Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>greenflame blade, sword burst</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>flame cyclone</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>burning blade</i><br/><br/><h3>ENSNARING SWORDMAGE</h3>You are a sly hunter who closes in on your prey, punishing an enemy for any missteps, and hounding it until it is vanquished. As an ensnaring swordmage, you are a clever defender who gains the tactically advantageous ground in a fight. You circle opponents and entrap them with careful swordplay, entangling spells, and cunning feints. You might also charge a foe to try to gain the advantage or to keep the creature from your allies.<br/>Your use of spells to ensnare opponents requires physical and mental endurance. Intelligence should be your primary ability score, because it determines the accuracy and potency of your spells. You should also have a high Constitution score to strengthen your ensnaring spells.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: aegis of ensnarement<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Grasping Ensnarement<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>luring strike, lightning lure</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox’s feint</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>dragon’s teeth</i><br/><br/><h3>SHIELDING SWORDMAGE</h3>You protect your allies with magical shields of force—and by keeping enemies away from them. This heritage is embodied by the Coronal Guard tradition, a discipline that can be traced over a thousand years to the armathors, the elite guards of the coronal of Myth Drannor. Intelligence powers your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Constitution applies added effects to many of your attacks, so it should be your second-highest score. A good Strength lets you take advantage of assault swordmage powers (giving you some added offense) and keeps your basic attack decent. You’ll want to keep a hand free to get your AC bonus from Swordmage Warding class feature, so you should use a one-handed weapon such as a longsword or a scimitar.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Retributive Shield (Human feat: Student of Sword Magic)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Diplomacy, History, Insight<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>booming blade, lightning lure</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>chilling blow</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>frost backlash</i><br/><br/><h3>SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Swordmages are smart, strong bastions of defense whose art is embodied by their swords. All swordmages have the class features described below.<br/><br/><b>SWORDBOND</b><br/>By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.<br/><br/>You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.<br/><br/>If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can’t use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)<br/><br/><b>SWORDMAGE AEGIS</b><br/>You can place a magical warding upon a foe, allowing you to respond to the foe’s attacks against your allies with a counterassault or a timely protection. Choose one Aegis and gain its benefit.<br/><br/><b>Aegis of Assault</b><br/>You can use the Aegis of Assault power to teleport to the side of of the attacker and respond with an attack of your own.<br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Swordmage Feature </span>Aegis of Assault</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You create an arcane link between you and a foe, allowing you to instantly respond to its attacks with a counterassault.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark other creatures using other powers, the target is still marked. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your marked target makes an attack that doesn’t include you as a target, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. If that attack hits and the marked target is within 10 squares of you, you can use an immediate reaction to teleport to a square adjacent to the target and make a melee basic attack against it. If no unoccupied space exists adjacent to the target, you can’t use this immediate reaction.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Aegis of Ensnarement</b><br/>You can use the Aegis of ensnarement  power to teleport a marked creature to any space adjacent to you.<br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Swordmage Feature </span>Aegis of Ensnarement</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You create an arcane link between yourself and a foe, allowing you to ensnare that creature.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark another creature using other powers, the target is still marked.<br/>Until the mark ends, if the target makes any attack that does not include you as a target, it takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll.<br/>If a target marked by this power is within 10 squares of you when it hits with an attack that does not include you as a target, you can use an immediate reaction after the target’s entire attack is resolved to teleport the target to any space adjacent to you. In addition, the target grants combat advantage to all creatures until the end of your next turn. If no unoccupied space exists adjacent to you, you can’t use this immediate reaction, and the target doesn’t grant combat advantage as a result of this effect.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Aegis of Shielding</b><br/>You can use the Aegis of Shielding power to deflect some of the damage of an incoming attack.<br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Swordmage Feature </span>Aegis of Shielding</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You create an arcane link between you and an enemy, allowing you to blunt its attacks against your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target. If you mark other creatures using other powers, the target is still marked. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your marked target makes an attack that doesn’t include you as a target, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. If that attack hits and the marked target is  within 10 squares of you, you can use an immediate interrupt to reduce the damage dealt by that attack to any one creature by an amount equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier.<br/>At 11th level, reduce the damage dealt by 10 + your Constitution modifier. At 21st level, reduce the damage dealt by 15 + your Constitution modifier.</p><br/></p><br/><b>SWORDMAGE WARDING</b><br/>While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you.<br/>This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else).<br/><br/>SWORDMAGE OVERVIEW <br/>Your melee skills are most important, but you also have attacks that can hit multiple creatures or injure creatures at range. Your defensive powers can protect your allies and yourself.<br/><br/>Religion<br/>Swordmages favor deities of magic or skill. Corellon, Selûne, Torm, and Tymora are common among swordmages of good heart. Swordmages of a darker bent often revere Shar, regarding their unusual skills as a secret art to be kept hidden from the uninitiated.<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Your blade adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when used as an implement. You do not gain your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when using your blade as an implement.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 24.</p>
