Perhaps your character has moved on from military service to a new area of expertise, or maybe you have taken up the sword as part of a new direction in your life after months or years of other studies.<br/><br/>As a hybrid fighter, you protect your comrades as any other defender does: with durability, martial prowess, and battlefield control. However, you give up some of the fighter’s talent with weapons, and you can’t mark enemies with all your powers.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID FIGHTER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>COMBAT CHALLENGE (HYBRID)</b><br/>Every time you attack an enemy with your fighter powers or your fighter paragon path powers, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls if its attack doesn’t include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.<br/>In addition, you gain the Combat Challenge power.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>COMBAT SPECIALTY</b><br/>When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features.<br/><br/><b>Combat Agility (Hybrid)</b><br/>This class feature replaces the Combat Superiority class feature. You gain the power Combat Agility.<br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Fighter Attack </span>Combat Agility</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your foe might think it has escaped you, but in its moment of triumph, you chase it down and make it pay.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Martial</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy adjacent to you takes an action that provokes an opportunity attack</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: After the triggering enemy completes the action, you shift a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier.

An enemy struck by your opportunity attack stops moving, if a move provoked the attack. If it still has actions remaining, it can use them to resume moving.<br/><br/><b>FIGHTER ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, light shields, and heavy shields.<br/><br/><b>FIGHTER COMBAT TALENT</b><br/>When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features.<br/><br/><b>Battlerager Vigor (Hybrid)</b><br/>Whenever you hit an enemy with a melee or a close attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, plus any temporary hit points normally granted by the power. You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved.<br/>If you use an invigorating fighter attack power and miss every target with it, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/><br/><b>Brawler Style (Hybrid)</b><br/>While you wield a weapon in your primary hand and your off hand is free or grabbing a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Fortitude.<br/><br/>In addition, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to the attack rolls of unarmed attacks and a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of grab attacks and attacks to move a creature you’re grabbing. These bonuses increase to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>One-handed Weapon Talent (Hybrid)</b><br/>When using a one-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls.<br/><br/><b>Tempest Technique (Hybrid)</b><br/>When you wield two melee weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with weapons that have the offhand property. You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites.<br/>When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks when you are wielding two weapons. This bonus increases to +2 with weapons that have the off-hand property.<br/><br/><b>Two-handed Weapon Talent (Hybrid)</b><br/>When using a two-handed weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>A fighter/paladin draws on two different flavors of tenacity and resilience to create a single defender.<br/><br/>By adding hybrid warlord to hybrid fighter, you can dabble in either tactical genius or inspirational brilliance without giving up melee prowess.<br/><br/>If you’re looking to add some nonmelee attacks to your hybrid fighter, consider the hybrid invoker. You don’t give up much AC (particularly if you are going to wield a two-handed weapon), and it doesn’t hurt for a fighter to have a high Wisdom score.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 144.</p>
