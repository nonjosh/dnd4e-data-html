		<h1 class="player">Barbarian</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. You use powerful two-handed weapons to deal serious damage to your enemies. Your physical power and daunting presence can cause foes to cower before you, and you can temporarily increase your abilities by harnessing great bursts of terrifying rage. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either defender or leader as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Primal. You are a primal champion, a warrior devoted to the natural world and an embodiment of your tribe’s fierce traditions.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Constitution, Charisma<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Fortitude.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 15+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 6<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 8+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level.<br/><i>Class Skills</i>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis).<br/><br/><b>Build Options: </b>Rageblood Barbarian, Thaneborn Barbarian, Thunderborn Barbarian, Whirling Barbarian.<br/><b>Class features: </b>Barbarian Agility, Feral Might, Rage Strike, Rampage.<br/></blockquote></p>Barbarians are savage warriors who deal out powerful blows from their mighty weapons. They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy’s strike. For barbarians’ foes, the moments of greatest terror come when barbarians call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals.<br/>As a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors of your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers.<br/>When the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake?<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A BARBARIAN</H3>You can choose any barbarian powers you like for your character, though many barbarians favor one of two builds: the rageblood barbarian or the thaneborn barbarian. All barbarians rely on Strength. Barbarians also benefit from a high Constitution or Charisma, depending on which expression of the class they favor.<br/><h3>RAGEBLOOD BARBARIAN</h3>You can withstand a great deal of physical punishment, especially when you are in the throes of rage. At higher levels, your powers, particularly your rages, visibly manifest the spirits sacred to your tribe. Strength should be your highest ability score, since you use it for your attacks, but make Constitution a close second. Charisma might be your third-best score, especially if you want to use some powers designed for the thaneborn barbarian build. Rageblood barbarians lean toward defender as a secondary role.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Rageblood Vigor<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Expertise<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>devastating strike, recuperating strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>avalanche strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bloodhunt rage</i><br/><br/><h3>THANEBORN BARBARIAN</h3>You use primal power to fuel your mighty rages and lend power to your already imposing personal presence. Your combination of physical prowess and charismatic appeal draws allies to you as surely as it fills your foes with fear. Again, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Charisma and then Constitution. Thaneborn barbarians lean toward leader as a secondary role.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Thaneborn Triumph<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Rising Fury<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>howling strike, pressing strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>vault the fallen</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>macetail’s rage</i><br/><br/><h3>THUNDERBORN BARBARIAN</h3>Some barbarians can be mistaken for savage warriors bereft of magic, at least until they rage. Whether you are raging or not, no one makes that mistake about you. Your ferocity and power have endeared you to the primal spirits of thunder. They circle around you, waiting for a time when you unleash them on your enemies.<br/><br/>When you stride into battle, low thunder rumbles around you. Even underground or on a clear day, the deep-throated murmur of distant storms accompanies you. When you charge, the growl grows into thunderclaps, sounding nearby. When you shriek your battle cry, a booming roar breaks over your enemies.<br/><br/>The faint-hearted cower before you. Those who are brave or foolish enough to stand before the rumble of your approach are laid low by your weapons and your rage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Thunderborn Wrath<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Thunderborn Rage<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Nature<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>howling strike, howl of fury</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>shout of terror</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>tyrant’s rage<br/></i><br/><br/><h3>WHIRLING BARBARIAN</h3>Some barbarians, particularly elves and half-orcs, rely on speed and startling force to slay their enemies. Stories abound of the ability of such barbarians to cut down an entire group of bandits in the blink of an eye. These whirling barbarians combine supreme speed and agility with great strength.<br/><br/>Whirling barbarians fight with two weapons, often a pair of axes or swords. Dwarf whirling barbarians favor battleaxes and war picks, whereas half-orcs lean toward clubs and maces.<br/><br/>Compared to other barbarians, whirling barbarians are more mobile and better able to deal damage to several enemies with a single attack. Such barbarians rove the battlefield, swinging their weapons in a blur and hewing down any foes that are rash enough to draw near.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Whirling Slayer<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>pressing strike, whirling rend</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>whirling frenzy</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>thunder hooves rage</i><br/><br/><h3>BARBARIAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>BARBARIAN AGILITY</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and Reflex. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>FERAL MIGHT</b><br/>Barbarians connect with the natural world in a variety of ways. Some barbarians grow so hardened to physical punishment that they find it easier to simply absorb, rather than avoid, attacks. Others are living examples of the power of one’s will to shape one’s fate. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Rageblood Vigor</b><br/>You gain the swift charge power. In addition, whenever your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of temporary hit points equals 5 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>Swift Charge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your foe falls, you rush toward your next victim.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You charge an enemy.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Thaneborn Triumph</b><br/>You gain the roar of triumph power.

In addition, once per round when your attack bloodies an enemy, you can shift 2 squares as a free action, and each enemy adjacent to you at the end of the shift grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>Whirling Lunge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Striking down one foe, you whirl deeper into enemy ranks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 2 squares and then deal 1[W] damage (off-hand weapon) to an enemy adjacent to you that you can see.</p><br/></p><br/><b>RAGE STRIKE</b><br/>Barbarian daily attack powers have the rage keyword. They allow you to unleash powerful bursts of emotion, willpower, and primal energy. Each rage power starts with a mighty attack, and then you enter a rage, which grants an ongoing benefit.<br/>At 5th level, you gain the rage strike power, which lets you channel an unused rage power into a devastating attack while you’re raging. Using rage strike is an alternative to using a second rage power in a climactic battle; it gives you the damage output of a daily power without forcing you to enter a different rage.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>Rage Strike</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You channel your primal rage into a devastating attack.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be raging and have at least one unused rage power.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Strength vs. AC.
