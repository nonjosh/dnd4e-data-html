		<h1 class="player">Ardent</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. You fill your allies with the will to fight and the clarity of purpose needed for victory. When you attack, you loose thoughts that intensify emotions and lay bare truths. Depending on your choice of class features, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. You are a spiritual warrior whose thoughts swirl about you to infect your enemies with doubt and fill your allies with confidence.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Charisma, Constitution, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 7+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 4 trained skills at 1st level.<br/><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Build Options: </b>Enlightened Ardent, Euphoric Ardent, Impetuous Ardent.<br/><b>Class features: </b>Ardent Mantle, Ardent Surge, Psionic Augmentation.<br/></blockquote></p>Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind’s defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, you excite such emotions in your enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling your allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.<br/><br/>Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How you discovered your psionic talent can shape how you wield this power now. You might have awakened to your talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed you to augment your attacks by rending your enemies’ minds. Or your friends might reflect your power when your mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match your own. Regardless of the revelation, you learned to harness this power to support your fighting prowess and to guide your allies to victory.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A ARDENT</H3>Ardents depend on Charisma more than other abilities. Constitution is important for powers that improve your allies’ attacks, and Wisdom is important if you want to foil your enemies’ attacks. You can choose any powers you like, though many ardents favor one of the two builds described here.<br/><h3>ENLIGHTENED ARDENT</h3>You read your enemies’ weaknesses and reveal them to your allies, and your keen insight helps your allies overcome damaging effects. Make Charisma your highest ability score. You should also consider investing in Wisdom to take advantage of powers that confuse your enemies. Your secondary role is defender, and your leadership helps protect allies from harm.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Clarity<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Bolstering Mantle<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>focusing strike, psionic shield</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Clarity<br/>Feat: Bolstering Mantle<br/>Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Heal, Insight<br/>At-Will Powers: focusing strike, psionic shield<br/>Daily Power: wormhole plunge</i><br/><br/><h3>EUPHORIC ARDENT</h3>You can scarcely contain the emotions that strain against your will like a crashing tide. When you make your attacks, they flood out of you, increasing your allies’ confidence and washing away your enemies’ courage. Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by a high Constitution score to improve those effects that raise your allies’ spirits and diminish your enemies’ capabilities. If you want to diversify your powers, a high Wisdom can’t hurt, but you should also look to Dexterity for initiative checks and Reflex. Your secondary role is striker, and your powers can augment your allies’ attacks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Elation<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Heartening Surge<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demoralizing strike, ire strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Elation<br/>Feat: Heartening Surge<br/>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate, Streetwise<br/>At-Will Powers: demoralizing strike, ire strike<br/>Daily Power: battleborn acuity</i><br/><br/><h3>IMPETUOUS ARDENT</h3>Impetuous ardents have little use for caution or careful planning, and they allow their natural talent and fate to guide their actions. As an impetuous ardent, your secondary role is striker. Choose powers that deliver punishing damage, improve your allies’ attacks, or strip away your enemies’ ability to protect themselves. Any power that can help to quickly remove an enemy’s threat reinforces your preferred tactics. This said, wading through enemies places you at great risk. To mitigate the dangers arrayed against you, be sure to invest in feats and powers that help you last in combat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charisma should be your highest ability score. Look to your Dexterity score next to let you act sooner in the round and to keep your Reflex high. Round out your defenses and hit points by making Constitution your third highest ability score.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Mantle of Impulsiveness<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Deft Eruption<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>impetuous ruin, part the fog</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Mantle of Impulsiveness<br/>Feat: Deft Eruption<br/>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Intimidate<br/>At-Will Powers: impetuous ruin, part the fog<br/>Daily Power: battle flow</i><br/><br/><h3>ARDENT CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Ardents have the following class features.<br/><br/><b>ARDENT MANTLE</b><br/>A person’s state of mind can be armor against the decay and madness born from base emotions, and thus ardents gird themselves by donning particular mindsets to ward off the perils brought on by fear, despair, and hatred. Various emotional states, called mantles, can safeguard the mind. Ardents most commonly use the mantles of clarity and elation.<br/><br/><b>Mantle of Clarity</b><br/>You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. (If a character is in the radius of more than one Mantle of Clarity, the bonuses are not cumulative. Only the highest ones apply to him or her.)<br/>You also gain the ardent alacrity power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Feature </span>Ardent Alacrity</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you take a hit, your emotional energy inspires your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>No Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You are bloodied by an attack</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Each target can use a free action either to shift 1 square or to move half his or her speed.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Mantle of Elation</b><br/>You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to damage rolls for opportunity attacks.

You also gain the ardent eruption power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ardent Surge: When you use your ardent surge power, the target also gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Feature </span>Ardent Eruption</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your pain bleeds from you in a wave, touching your allies and lending new ferocity to their attacks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>No Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You are bloodied by an attack</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target gains a +2 bonus to his or her damage rolls until the start of your next turn.<br/>Level 11: +4 bonus.<br/>Level 21: +6 bonus.</p><br/></p><br/><b>ARDENT SURGE</b><br/>You gain the ardent surge power.

At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round.</p><br/></p><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br/>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don’t start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Choose two</td><td>Gain 2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Choose one</td><td>Gain 2 (4 total)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (6 total)</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 1 (7 total)</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (9 total)</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>—</td><td>Gain 2 (11 total)</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (13 total)</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (15 total)</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The Augmentable keyword<br/><br/>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br/><br/>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power’s effects.<br/><br/>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, "Augment 1" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br/><br/>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can’t, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br/><br/>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as "Hit" or "Effect," that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br/><br/>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn’t have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br/><br/>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
