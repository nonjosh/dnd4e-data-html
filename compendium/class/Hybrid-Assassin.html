		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Assassin</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Shadow. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather; light shields.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple one-handed melee, simple ranged, military heavy blade, military light blade.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Ki focuses<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 5+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Endurance (Con), Insight (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha), Thievery (Dex).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Assassin's Shroud (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Guild Training (Hybrid), Shade Form or Shadow Step.<br/></blockquote></p>You have accepted your dark reflection and understand its place in your soul. Yet you are unwilling to surrender completely to the darkness you now harbor. <br/><br/>What drove you to seek out the Shadowfell’s power? Were you driven by grief, guilt, hatred, or vengeance? Something else? Is your divided focus the result of an incomplete bond? Or do you dabble in other areas to better conceal your sinister nature?<br/><br/>As a hybrid assassin, you can call forth shrouds to help guide your attacks where they can deal the most damage, but you sacrifice many of the techniques assassins use to evade their enemies.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID ASSASSIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>ASSASSIN'S SHROUD (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the assassin power assassin’s shroud, except you can subject a target to a maximum of two shrouds and you can invoke your shrouds on a target only when you attack with an assassin power or an assassin paragon path power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Assassin Feature </span>Assassin's Shroud</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You cause invisible shrouds to settle on your foe. At your command, the shrouds reveal the target’s weak points to your keen gaze.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Shadow</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One enemy you can see in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You subject the target to your shroud. If any of your shrouds are already on the target, you subject it to an additional shroud, up to a maximum of four. The shrouds last until you use this power against a different enemy or until the end of the encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you make an attack roll against the target, you choose to invoke either all your shrouds on it or none of them. If you invoke your shrouds, the attack deals 1d6 damage per shroud, minus one shroud if the attack misses, and all your shrouds then vanish from the target. This damage roll never benefits from bonuses to damage rolls, and is in addition to the attack’s damage, if any.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: 1d6 + 3 damage per shroud.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 1d6 + 6 damage per shroud.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power only on your turn and only once per turn.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>GUILD TRAINING (HYBRID)</b><br/>Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild.<br/><br/>Assassins’ guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers’ trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions.<br/><br/>Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Bleak Disciple (Hybrid)</b><br/>When you hit an unbloodied target with an assassin attack power or assassin paragon path power, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. Add 2 to the temporary hit points gained at 11th level and 4 at 21st level.<br/><br/>Githyanki brought the tradition of the Bleak Disciple from the Astral Sea. It teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated.<br/><br/><b>Night Stalker (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain a bonus to damage rolls with assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers equal to your Charisma modifier against any target that is adjacent to none of your enemies.<br/><br/>The drow assassins who founded this guild at Lolth’s instruction held that fear and misdirection are as deadly as a poisoned blade. This tradition teaches how best to draw on shadow magic to terrorize and deceive enemies.<br/><br/><b>SHADE FORM</b><br/>You gain the shade form power. When you gave part of your soul to the Shadowfell, the power of that dark realm fused with your material form. As a result, you can assume a shadowy form that allows you to pass through barriers and evade enemies that you could not normally avoid.<br/><br/>When you adopt this form, you blur, your skin becomes gray, and all the gear you carry and the clothes you wear adopt similarly dull colors. Your eyes lose their pupils, becoming blank, white orbs. You cannot damage your foes without returning to your normal form, which prevents you from doing more than maneuvering in for the kill against your enemies.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Assassin Feature </span>Shade Form</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You transform yourself into a being of shadow, becoming more difficult to notice and to harm.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Shadow</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You assume a shadowy form that lasts until you make an attack roll or until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you are insubstantial, and you gain vulnerable 5 radiant. In addition, you can make Stealth checks to become hidden if you have any cover or concealment, and you can use cover granted by your allies both to become hidden and to remain hidden.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: The form persists.</p><br/></p><b>SHADOW STEP</b><br/>You gain the shadow step power. The shadow energy surrounding every creature touches the Shadowfell slightly, for the realm of death is a creature’s eventual destination. You have the ability to walk the shadow pathways from one creature to another.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Assassin Feature </span>Shadow Step</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You vanish into the shadow energy around one creature and then step out of it near another creature.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Shadow</b>, <b>Teleportation</b><br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be adjacent to a creature.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You teleport 3 squares to a square adjacent to a different creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: Teleport 4 squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: Teleport 5 squares.</p><br/></p>Suggested Combinations<br/>Assassins combine best with other striker classes since doing so provides two methods for dealing striker damage. The strongest combinations include assassin/rogue, assassin/monk, and assassin/ranger. If you want to develop leader techniques, the assassin/bard is a good choice. For defender, think about the assassin/paladin to improve your durability and gain self-healing. Combining an assassin with controller classes is difficult since few abilities overlap. To add control techniques, you are served better by picking up the sorcerer or warlock. Although they are not controllers, many spells available to them have controller effects.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 32.</p>
