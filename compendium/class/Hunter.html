In ages past, rangers kept the peace along the farthest frontiers of civilization, wandering the land to root out monsters and keep the roads clear of threats. Today, the empires of old are long gone, their roads fallen into ruin. Yet even as the encroaching darkness grows ever bolder, rangers continue the valiant fight to keep the borderlands safe and secure. So well do they perform this task that many of those on the frontier never realize the debt they owe to those who protect them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many common folk are suspicious of rangers, knowing their kind only as loners who have no ties to kin or community. Indeed, some rangers eventually become little more than hermits watching over specific areas of the wild. However, as the darkness encroaches upon civilization, many rangers take on a protective role that prompts them to wander throughout all settled lands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ranger’s abilities reflect the divide between civilization and wilderness. Although rangers learn to master weapons, most commonly bows and those used in two-weapon fighting, they augment this martial training with their knowledge of primal magic. A ranger in the wild counts on his or her woodcraft and mastery of magic to survive.<br/><br/><h3>RANGER (HUNTER) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><h3>Level 1:</h3><b>ARCHERY STYLE</b><br/>You gain one of the following features depending on your choice of ranged weapon.<br/><br/><b>Bow Hunter</b><br/>You gain the Bow Expertise feat.<br/><br/><b>Crossbow Hunter</b><br/>You gain the Crossbow Expertise feat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if a crossbow you wield has the load minor property, you can instead reload it as a free action.<br/><br/><b>ASPECTS OF THE WILD (HUNTER)</b><br/>You gain two of the following powers of your choice.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Ranger Utility </span>Aspect of the Cunning Fox</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Like a fox, you move with stealth, speed, and cunning.
