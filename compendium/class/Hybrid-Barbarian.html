		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Barbarian</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Primal. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Constitution, Charisma<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 7.5+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 3<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 4<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Rampage<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Barbarian Armored Agility or Feral Might.<br/></blockquote></p>In your heart, you know the power of rage. However, your link to the primal spirits that unleash these rages isn’t quite as strong as a typical barbarian’s. Perhaps you’ve been away from the tribe for too long, or maybe you have only begun to harness primal power. Regardless of the reason, as a hybrid barbarian you can’t unleash the burning rage in your heart quite as easily as a full member of that class, but you remain capable of occasional frenzied bursts of energy.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID BARBARIAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>RAMPAGE</b><br/>Once per round, when you score a critical hit with a barbarian attack power, you can immediately make a melee basic attack as a free action. You do not have to attack the same target that you scored a critical hit against.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>BARBARIAN ARMORED AGILITY</b><br/>You gain the Barbarian Agility class feature. You also gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor.<br/><br/><b>FERAL MIGHT</b><br/>Barbarians connect with the natural world in a variety of ways. Some barbarians grow so hardened to physical punishment that they find it easier to simply absorb, rather than avoid, attacks. Others are living examples of the power of one’s will to shape one’s fate. Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain barbarian powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Rageblood Vigor</b><br/>You gain the swift charge power. In addition, whenever your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of temporary hit points equals 5 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>Swift Charge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As your foe falls, you rush toward your next victim.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You charge an enemy.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Thaneborn Triumph</b><br/>You gain the roar of triumph power.

In addition, once per round when your attack bloodies an enemy, each enemy adjacent to you takes thunder damage equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>War Cry</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your potent victory cry sends nearby enemies reeling in terror.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fear</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the blast</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You push each target 1 square.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Whirling Slayer</b><br/>You gain the whirling lunge power, and you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand and treat it as an off-hand weapon. In addition, once per round when your attack bloodies an enemy, you can shift 2 squares as a free action, and each enemy adjacent to you at the end of the shift grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Barbarian Feature </span>Whirling Lunge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Striking down one foe, you whirl deeper into enemy ranks.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: Your attack reduces an enemy to 0 hit points</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You shift 2 squares and then deal 1[W] damage (off-hand weapon) to an enemy adjacent to you that you can see.</p><br/></p><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The hybrid barbarian can be joined with the hybrid fighter for great durability and melee prowess. Choose a Hybrid Talent option to improve your AC, either Barbarian Armored Agility or Fighter Armor Proficiency.<br/><br/>If you are a barbarian/cleric who chooses Strength-based healing powers, you gain valuable healing capability that you can use to keep yourself fighting.<br/><br/>A barbarian/ranger is a potent combatant. Such a character can use barbarian powers requiring a two-handed weapon as well as ranger powers requiring two melee weapons.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 141.</p>
