What keeps you from achieving this focus? Have you recognized that runic study alone is insufficient to stand against the forces of evil? Or have you started dabbling in rune magic to enhance your already formidable talents in battle?<br/><br/>As a hybrid runepriest, you forgo some battlefield healing and mastery of basic runes in exchange for a second class’s features and powers.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID RUNEPRIEST CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>RUNE OF MENDING (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the runepriest power rune of mending. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Runepriest Feature </span>Rune of Mending</h1><p class="flavor"><i>The healing rune flares with a cold blue fire as you trace it in the air. The rune then appears on your allies’ armor.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Healing</b>, <b>Runic</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge.<br/>Level 6: The target regains 1d6 additional hit points.<br/>Level 11: The target regains 2d6 additional hit points.<br/>Level 16: The target regains 3d6 additional hit points.<br/>Level 21: The target regains 4d6 additional hit points.<br/>Level 26: The target regains 5d6 additional hit points.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rune of Destruction</b>: You and each ally in the burst gain a +2 power bonus to damage rolls (+4 power bonus at 11th level and +6 power bonus at 21st level) until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rune of Protection</b>: You and each ally in the burst gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round.</p><br/></p><b>RUNIC ARTISTRY</b><br/>Runepriests follow one of the major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer, the way of the Defiant Word or the tradition of the Serene Blade.<br/><br/><b>Defiant Word</b><br/>Whenever an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy misses you in a round.<br/><br/><b>Serene Blade</b><br/>You gain proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed military heavy blades. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC. Once per round immediately after an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. The number of temporary hit points increases to 5 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level and 10 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>Wrathful Hammer</b><br/>You gain proficiency with military hammers and military maces. In addition, whenever an enemy deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier, regardless of the number of times the enemy damages you in a round.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>RUNE MASTER</b><br/>Some of your powers have the runic keyword. When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power—either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection—and then use the power, applying the chosen rune’s effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you’re in the rune state.<br/><br/><b>Rune of Destruction</b><br/>Allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies that are adjacent to you or to any other runepriests who are in this rune state.<br/><br/><b>Rune of Protection</b><br/>While adjacent to you, allies gain resist 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>RUNEPRIEST ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, and light shields.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/>The cleric/runepriest combines leadership from two divine classes, offering a wealth of story and tactical options. Make Strength and Wisdom your two best ability scores, with either Constitution or Charisma in third place.<br/><br/>Both the fighter/runepriest and the paladin/runepriest offer similar blends of the leader and defender roles, and also allow you to maximize your class armor proficiencies. Strength should be your primary ability score, with Constitution or Wisdom a good second choice.<br/><br/>The barbarian/runepriest provides a hefty dose of damage-dealing capability, allowing you to put the fear of your god into foes. Your highest ability score should be Strength, with Constitution second.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 149.</p>
