Scoundrels find success on the battlefield by using every trick at their disposal to deceive, mislead, and ambush their enemies. They draw on their many skills to give them an edge in combat, whether that edge enables them to snatch a treasure from a villain or leap away at the last moment to thwart an attack. Scoundrels are survivors, and they are not above getting their hands dirty to win the day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scoundrel relies on clever planning and quick wits to survive. A thief focuses more broadly on acrobatics and unpredictable maneuvers. Scoundrels trade the thief ’s reliable tricks for a broader, more unpredictable range of abilities. These martial powers, or exploits, mirror the scoundrel’s preferred tactics and arise from a mix of training, improvisation, and skill. Some scoundrels favor punishing exploits, focusing on hitting hard and inflicting terrible injuries. Others use witty banter and feints to frustrate and misdirect opponents. Others still favor acrobatics, menace, or secrecy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoundrels are adventurers first and foremost. One might have learned the trade on the streets, might have developed his or her powers out of necessity after fate betrayed them, or could have been apprenticed to a master thief. Some scoundrels join adventuring parties for the promise of treasure and have few reservations about exploring dusty tombs and labyrinthine dungeons as long as there’s a reward on the other side. Not all scoundrels are that mercenary, however. There are things other than loot that are worth fighting for.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A ROGUE (SCOUNDREL)</H3><br/><h3>AERIALIST ROGUE</h3>All rogues are known for their agility and daring, but you take both to the next level. Ducking under a giant’s club isn’t enough; you leap over it and cartwheel to safety. You’re a masterful mover and an expert top-story burglar, using your abilities to tumble into the fray, into high openings, and out of all sorts of tight spots. Dexterity is your primary ability score, because you rely on it for your attacks and acrobatic stunts. Charisma is secondary for you, useful in avoiding opportunity attacks if you employ the Artful Dodger tactic. Strength serves you well as a tertiary ability, helping your Athletics checks in particular.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Defensive Mobility (Human feat: Sure Climber)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, riposte strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>fox’s gambit</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>handspring assault</i><br/><br/><h3>BRAWNY ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deal plenty of damage, aided by your Strength, and also stun, immobilize, knock down, or push your foes. Your attacks use Dexterity, so keep that your highest ability score. Strength should be a close second—it increases your damage directly, and it can determine other effects of your attacks. Charisma is a good third ability score, particularly if you want to dabble in powers from the other rogue build. Select the brutal scoundrel rogue tactic, and look for powers that pack a lot of damage into every punch.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus (Human feat: Toughness)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Dungeoneering, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>piercing strike, riposte strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>torturous strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>easy target</i><br/><br/><h3>CUTTHROAT ROGUE</h3>Leave smiles and misdirection to the tricksters. Instead, you use your animal magnetism in a more beastly way, oozing menace and implying a willingness to allow those who cross you to linger in pain. A friendly manner is for the weak; you achieve your way through tough words, hard looks, and the ability to back up either. Your attacks use Dexterity, so that should be your highest ability score. Charisma follows as a close second, essential for getting your way by using Intimidate. Strength comes in third; it’s useful in delivering brutal attacks if you employ the Ruthless Ruffian tactic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Press the Advantage (Human feat: Backstabber)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, Stealth, Streetwise, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>disheartening strike, sly flourish</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>termination threat</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>checking jab</i><br/><br/><h3>SHADOWY ROGUE</h3>As your allies charge into battle, you hang back and take cover. While swords swing and spells explode, you carefully choose your target, line up your shot, and fire. The enemy staggers from your deadly attack, and by the time it has begun to look for you, you’ve vanished. You send death hurtling from your crossbow or sling, relentlessly assaulting your enemies. You pepper your foes with missiles, lending support to your allies without risking your own skin.<br/>Shadowy rogues use powers that improve concealment and cover. Shadowy rogues want powers they can use from range, though it’s a good idea to pick a few melee powers as well. Any powers that let you move as part of your attack are excellent choices, because they can help you become hidden using the Cunning Sneak class feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Cunning Sneak, Sharpshooter Talent<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Swift Footwork<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Athletics, Dungeoneering, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>gloaming cut, piercing strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>distracting shot</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>scattering shot</i><br/><br/><h3>TRICKSTER ROGUE</h3>You like powers that deceive and misdirect your foes. You dart in and out of the fray in combat, dodging your enemies’ attacks or redirecting them to other foes. Most of your attack powers rely on Dexterity, so that should be your best ability score. Charisma is important for a few attacks, for Charisma-based skills you sometimes use in place of attacks, and for other effects that depend on successful attacks, so make Charisma your second-best score. Strength is useful if you want to choose powers intended for the other rogue build. Select the artful dodger rogue tactic. Look for powers that take advantage of your high Charisma score, as well as those that add to your trickster nature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Backstabber (Human feat: Human Perseverance)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Bluff, Insight, Perception, Stealth, Thievery<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>deft strike, sly flourish</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>positioning strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>trick strike</i><br/><br/><h3>ROGUE (SCOUNDREL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>All rogues share these class features.<br/><br/><b>FIRST STRIKE</b><br/>At the start of every encounter, you have combat advantage against any creatures that have not yet acted in that encounter.<br/><br/><b>ROGUE TACTICS</b><br/>You gain one of the benefits described below, depending on your choice of Rogue Tactics. Your choice also provides additional benefits to certain rogue powers, as detailed in those powers’ descriptions.<br/><br/><b>Artful Dodger</b><br/>You gain a bonus to AC against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier.<br/><br/><b>Brutal Scoundrel</b><br/>You gain a bonus to Sneak Attack damage. The bonus equals your Strength modifier.<br/><br/><b>Cunning Sneak</b><br/>You don’t take a penalty to Stealth checks for moving more than 2 squares, and you take a –5 penalty instead of a -10 penalty to Stealth checks for running.<br/><br/>If you end your movement at least 3 squares away from your starting position, you can make a Stealth check to become hidden if you have any concealment or any cover, except for cover provided by intervening allies.<br/><br/><b>Ruthless Ruffian</b><br/>You are proficient with the club and the mace, and you can use those weapons with Sneak Attack or any rogue power or rogue paragon path power that normally requires a light blade. If you use a club or a mace to deliver an attack that has the rattling keyword, add your Strength modifier to the damage roll.<br/><br/><b>SCOUNDREL WEAPON TALENT</b><br/>When you wield a shuriken, your weapon damage die increases by one size. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls with daggers.<br/><br/><b>SHARPSHOOTER TALENT</b><br/>This class feature replaces the Rogue Weapon Talent class feature.<br/><br/>Choose crossbows or slings. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with any weapon of the chosen group. You gain Far Shot as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites.<br/><br/><b>SNEAK ATTACK</b><br/>When you make an attack with a light blade, a hand crossbow, a shortbow, or a sling and hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, that enemy takes extra damage based on your level (see the Sneak Attack table). You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br/><br/>SNEAK ATTACK<br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Extra Damage</th></tr><tr><td>1–10</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>11–20</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>21–30</td><td>5d6</td></tr></table><br/><br/> (9/30/2011)<br/>Updated in Class Compendium.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 116, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd" target="_new">Class Compendium</a>.</p>
