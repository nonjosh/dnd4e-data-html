		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Avenger</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Divine. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Wisdom, Dexterity, Intelligence <br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Holy symbols<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 7+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 3<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3.5<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Stealth (Dex), Streetwise (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Oath of Enmity (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Armor of Faith, Avenger's Censure (Hybrid) or Channel Divinity (Hybrid Avenger).<br/></blockquote></p>You blend secret monastic training with other talents to become  a unique servant of the gods. Do your vows represent an earlier stage of your life, all but left behind, or a newfound mission?<br/>As a hybrid avenger, you pursue your foes with great skill, but you must sacrifice some of your offensive and defensive capabilities to dabble in a second class.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID AVENGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>OATH OF ENMITY (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the avenger power oath of enmity. The power functions as normal, except that you can apply the effect only when you make a melee attack using an avenger power or an avenger paragon path power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Avenger Feature </span>Oath of Enmity</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You focus your wrath on a single foe, giving your attacks against it extraordinary accuracy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One enemy you can see in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: When you make a melee attack against the target and the target is the only enemy adjacent to you, you make two attack rolls and use either result. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the target drops to 0 hit points, at which point you regain the use of this power.<br/>If another effect lets you roll twice and use the higher result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack. If an effect forces you to roll twice and use the lower result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack either.<br/>If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this power, you reroll both dice.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>ARMOR OF FAITH</b><br/>The favor of your deity wards you from harm. While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and arenâ€™t using a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to AC.<br/><br/><b>AVENGER'S CENSURE (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the avenger class feature, except that the bonus to damage rolls applies only to your avenger powers and avenger paragon path powers.<br/><br/><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY (HYBRID AVENGER)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the avenger class feature, except that you start with a single avenger Channel Divinity power of your choice.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The avenger/invoker enjoys a variety of melee and nonmelee attacks, all based on Wisdom. You can control enemies at a distance, making it even easier for you to hunt down your prey.<br/><br/>The avenger/wizard seems like an unusual combination at first glance, but both classes suggest the study of secret lore. With good Wisdom and Intelligence scores, you can achieve the same variety of attacks as an avenger/invoker can.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 140.</p>
