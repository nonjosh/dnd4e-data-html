		<h1 class="player">Druid</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Controller. Your beast form gives you access to powers that provide control at close range, while your humanoid form allows you to hinder your opponents from a distance. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you might lean toward either leader or striker as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Primal. You have gained your powers through a careful study of and communion with the natural world.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Staff, Totem<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 12+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 7+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: Nature.

They are capable of running with a wolf pack, speaking with the most ancient trees, and watching thunderstorms from atop the clouds themselves. They regard challenges as tests, both of their fitness and of their connection with the wild places of the world. And though many druids project an outward calm, they have the cunning of the beast and the fury of the storm.<br/>Whether you were born to the wilds or retreated from civilization, whether you chose your path or answered a call that whispered in your heart, you share a bond with the primal spirits of nature. You are neither their servant nor their master, but winds, trees, and beasts heed your words, for they recognize you as kin.<br/>Call to the spirits, and they will entangle your foes or smite your enemies with the storm. Unleash your own spirit, and you will become the Primal Beast, uncaged and untamed.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A DRUID</H3>Druids rely on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many druids choose powers that complement their choice of Primal Aspect.<br/><h3>GUARDIAN DRUID</h3>As a guardian druid, you are a protector of the land and those who rely on it. Yours is the magic of earth, forest, and sky, the enduring aspects of nature that outlive any mortal tyrant. Your powers incline you toward leader as a secondary role. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, since your attack powers rely on it, but make Constitution your second-best score to heighten your endurance and your guardian powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Guardian<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Primal Instinct<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Heal, Insight, Nature<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>call of the beast, chill wind, grasping claws</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>frost flash</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fires of life</i><br/><br/><h3>PREDATOR DRUID</h3>As a predator druid, you hunt down and destroy those who despoil the natural world. Yours is the magic of the bared fang, the stalking wolf pack, and the blood-red moon. Your powers make striker your secondary role, with a focus on dealing significant damage along with your control effects. Make Wisdom your highest ability score to get the most out of your attacks, followed by Dexterity to enhance your predator powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Predator<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Primal Fury<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Nature, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>flame seed, pounce, savage rend</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>darting bite</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>savage frenzy</i><br/><br/><h3>SWARM DRUID</h3>Druids call on forces associated with primal magic, such as beasts, plants, storms, and the earth. Swarm druids prefer to call on a particular primal force: insect swarms. Such druids see great strength in the unity of purpose and combined might of a colony of ants or a nest of hornets.<br/><br/>Most druids assume the forms of creatures such as bears, panthers, and rams, but a swarm druid splinters into hundreds of insects, all driven toward a single purpose by the druid’s mind. The druid is at once all the creatures in the swarm and none of them. Enemies might stomp at the swarm, crushing a beetle here and swatting a wasp there, but to the druid the loss of an individual in the swarm means nothing. It is the swarm as a whole—a dauntless tide of chitin and stingers—that matters.<br/><br/>Swarm druids are most often found in tropical climates. They typically dwell in jungles, where they have witnessed the power of an ant colony on the march. Druids of the Underdark also tend toward this discipline. In web-shrouded caves, drow and troglodyte swarm druids commune with spiders, mushroom forests, and creatures that have never seen the light of day.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Primal Swarm<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Toughness<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Nature, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>grasping claws, swarming locusts, thorn whip</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>scattered form</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fog of insects</i><br/><br/><h3>DRUID CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Druids have the following class features.<br/><br/><b>BALANCE OF NATURE</b><br/>Some druids favor being in beast form, while others prefer being in humanoid form. However, just as druids seek balance in the world between divine and primordial forces, druids pursue balance within their own minds and bodies.<br/>You begin with three at-will attack powers. Throughout your career, at least one of those powers, and no more than two, must have the beast form keyword. By this means, you have access to useful attacks in either beast form or humanoid form.<br/><br/><b>PRIMAL ASPECT</b><br/>Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world’s noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids’ visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers.<br/>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Primal Guardian</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br/><br/><b>Primal Predator</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed.<br/><br/><b>Primal Swarm</b><br/>While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you. When you take damage from either type of attack, the damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier.<br/><br/><b>Primal Wrath</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls of druid attack powers and druid paragon path attack powers that have the cold, fire, lightning, or thunder keywords.<br/><br/><b>RITUAL CASTING</b><br/>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.<br/><br/><b>WILD SHAPE</b><br/>As a druid, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form and transform into a beast. You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br/>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br/>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Druid Feature </span>Wild Shape</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your  humanoid form.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa. When you change from beast form back to your humanoid form, you can shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can’t use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape to change into beast form. The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your beast form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your beast form is inaccessible.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power once per round.</p><br/>Update (11/17/2010)<br/>In the first paragraph, replace the third sentence with the following text.<br/>"While you are in beast form, you can’t use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers."<br/><br/></p>DRUIDS AND RITUALS<br/>You own a ritual book, and it contains two rituals of your choice that you have mastered: Animal messenger and another 1st-level ritual.<br/>Once per day, you can use Animal Messenger without expending components<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Druids employ staffs and totems as a means of focusing their primal energy. When you wield a magic staff or a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of druid powers and druid paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 82.</p>
