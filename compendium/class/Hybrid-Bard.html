		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Bard</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Charisma, Intelligence, Constitution<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail; light shields.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, simple ranged, military ranged, longsword, scimitar, short sword.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Wands<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Reflex, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 6+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2.5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3.5<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Acrobatics (Dex), Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Streetwise (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Majestic Word (Hybrid), Skill Versatility<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Bard Armor Proficiency, Bardic Virtue, Song of Rest or Words of Friendship.<br/></blockquote></p>You are a dabbler among dabblers. The versatility of the typical bard isn’t enough for you, so you have branched out even further into other talents. Alternatively, you might have been incapable of mastering the bard’s full repertoire of performance and inspiration and have chosen to explore other areas to augment your abilities. As a hybrid bard, you retain some of the bard’s healing power, but trade away much of that class’s innate versatility in exchange for access to another class’s tricks.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID BARD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>MAJESTIC WORD (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the bard power majestic word. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bard Feature </span>Majestic Word</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You utter words laden with preternatural inspiration, restoring your ally’s stamina and making wounds seem insignificant.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level) </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.

The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Virtue of Cunning</b><br/>Once per round, when an enemy attack misses an ally within a number of squares of you equal to 5 + your Intelligence modifier, you can slide that ally 1 square as a free action.<br/><br/><b>Virtue of Prescience</b><br/>Once per encounter as an immediate interrupt, when an enemy hits one ally within 5 squares of you, you grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to the defense targeted by the triggering enemy until the end of that enemy’s turn.<br/><br/><b>Virtue of Valor</b><br/>Once per round, when any ally within 5 squares of you reduces an enemy to 0 hit points or bloodies an enemy, you can grant temporary hit points to that ally as a free action. The number of temporary hit points equals 1 + your Constitution modifier at 1st level, 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and 5 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>SONG OF REST</b><br/>When you play an instrument or sing during a short rest, you and each ally who can hear you are affected by your Song of Rest. When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge. A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time.<br/><br/><b>WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP</b><br/>You gain the words of friendship power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Bard Feature </span>Words of Friendship</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You infuse your words with arcane power, turning even the simplest speech into a compelling oration.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Charm</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You gain a +5 power bonus to the next Diplomacy check you make before the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The bard and warlock classes make a good hybrid combination, with complete overlap between primary and secondary abilities. Focus on ranged implement attacks when choosing bard powers.<br/><br/>A bard/paladin can mix leadership and defense and maintain accuracy with Charisma attack powers. You’ll need a little help with AC, particularly if you’re the only defender in the group.<br/><br/>Combining a bard with a warlord can create a leader who has powers that move allies and enemies around the battlefield with ease.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 141.</p>
