Many hybrid paladins have only recently pledged themselves to the path of the divine warrior after years spent in other pursuits. A few, however, have recognized that single-minded devotion isn’t for them and have expanded their abilities accordingly.<br/><br/>As a hybrid paladin, you bring a useful marking ability and strong melee powers to a group. Like other de-fenders, you are durable and can protect allies well, but you give up some healing capability to gain the tal-ents of another class.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID PALADIN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>DIVINE CHALLENGE (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the paladin power divine challenge. The power functions as normal, except that the radiant damage equals your Charisma modifier. The damage increases to 2 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 4 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Hybrid Paladin Feature </span>Divine Challenge (Hybrid)</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You boldly confront a nearby enemy, searing it with divine light if it ignores your challenge.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Radiant</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You mark the target. The target remains marked until you use this power against another target, or if you fail to engage the target (see below). A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.<br/>While the target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn’t include you as a target. The first time it makes an attack that doesn’t include you as a target before the start of your next turn, you can use an immediate reaction to deal radiant damage to the target equal to your Charisma modifier. The damage increases to 2 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 4 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.<br/>On your turn, you must engage the target you challenged or challenge a different target. To engage the target, you must either attack it or end your turn adjacent to it. If none of these events occur by the end of your turn, the marked condition ends and you can’t use divine challenge on your next turn.<br/>You can use divine challenge once per turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: Even though this ability is called a challenge, it doesn’t rely on the intelligence or language ability of the target. It’s a magical compulsion that affects the creature’s behavior, regardless of the creature’s nature. You can’t place a divine challenge on a creature that is already affected by your or another character’s divine challenge.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY (HYBRID PALADIN)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the paladin class feature, except that you start with a single paladin Channel Divinity power of your choice.<br/><br/><b>PALADIN ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, plate armor, light shields, and heavy shields.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>Combining the hybrid fighter with the hybrid paladin keeps your AC up and mixes two different styles of melee control.<br/><br/>It’s easy to see the value of combining paladin and cleric, but the paladin/warlord—favoring Charisma over Intelligence—might well be the most valiant battlefield leader imaginable.<br/><br/>Perhaps a strange combination, the paladin/warlock meshes melee prowess with deadly ranged attacks, as well as the ability to keep distant foes marked with divine challenge. For this combination, Paladin Armor Proficiency is a must-have option.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>.</p>
