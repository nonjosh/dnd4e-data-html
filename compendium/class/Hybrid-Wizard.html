		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Wizard</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Controller. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Arcane. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Dagger, quarterstaff.<br/><b>Implement: </b>Orbs, staffs, wands, tomes<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 5+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Nature (Wis), Religion (Int).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Cantrips<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Arcane Implement Mastery.<br/></blockquote></p>The path of wizardry demands focus and study, yet you have mastered several elements of arcane magic while still having time for other learning.<br/><br/>Did you give up a promising academic life to pursue a less sheltered existence? Did your mentor abandon you before sharing the final secrets of arcane lore? Or have you only recently begun the long task of master-ing the arcane power that permeates the cosmos?<br/><br/>As a hybrid wizard, you have much of a wizard’s versatility in power selection, but you give up the flexibility provided by the Ritual Casting and Spellbook class features, as well as the Arcane Implement Mastery class feature.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID WIZARD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>CANTRIPS</b><br/>You gain four cantrips of your choice.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>ARCANE IMPLEMENT MASTERY</b><br/>You specialize in the use of one kind of implement to gain additional abilities when you wield it. Choose one of the following forms of implement mastery: Orb of Imposition, Staff of Defense, Tome of Binding, Tome of Readiness, Wand of Accuracy.<br/><br/><b>Orb of Deception</b><br/>Once per encounter, you can use your orb of Deception power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Orb of Deception  Power</span>Orb of Deception</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Illusionist wizards select this form of mastery to spread a wider net of deception over foes.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: When you miss an enemy with a wizard illusion power</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Choose another enemy within 3 squares of the missed target. The chosen enemy cannot also be a target of the original attack. Repeat the attack against this new target, with a bonus to the attack roll equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Requirement</b>: You must wield an orb to benefit from this feature.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Orb of Imposition</b><br/>Once per encounter while you are holding an orb on your turn, you can use your orb of imposition power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Orb of Imposition  Power</span>Orb of Imposition</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Control wizards select this form of mastery because it helps extend the duration of their control effects.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You can use your orb to gain one of the following two effects.<br/>You can designate one creature you have cast a wizard spell upon that has an effect that lasts until the subject succeeds on a saving throw. That creature takes a penalty to its next saving throw against that effect equal to your Wisdom modifier.<br/>Alternatively, you can choose to extend the duration of an effect created by a wizard at-will spell (such as cloud of daggers or ray of frost) that would otherwise end at the end of your current turn. The effect instead ends at the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Requirement</b>: You must wield an orb to use this ability. </p><br/>Update (2/8/2010)<br/>In the second sentence of the second paragraph, replace “saving throws” with “next saving throw.” This saving throw limitation is part of a larger effort to mitigate the use of saving throw penalties to lock down enemies for the duration of an encounter.<br/><br/></p><br/><b>Staff of Defense</b><br/>A staff of defense grants you a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, once per encounter, you can use the Staff of Defense power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Staff of Defense  Power</span>Staff of Defense</h1><p class="flavor"><i>This form of mastery is useful for all wizards, particularly if you dabble in both control and damage-dealing spells.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: you gain a bonus to defense against one attack equal to your Constitution modifier. You can declare the bonus after the Dungeon Master has already told you the damage total. </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Requirement</b>: You must wield your staff.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Tome of Binding</b><br/>Once per encounter, as a free action, if you use your tome when using an arcane summoning power, all creatures summoned by that power gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Constitution modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoner wizards prefer this form of tome mastery because of its obvious benefits to their summoning spells. This form of mastery also provides benefits to certain conjuration powers.<br/><br/><b>Tome of Readiness</b><br/>When you select this form of implement mastery, choose a wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you don’t already know. That power is now stored and available for your use at a later time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once per encounter as a free action, you can use the stored power by expending another unused wizard encounter attack power of its level or higher. You must still take the normal action required to use the stored power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time you reach a level that lets you choose an encounter power, you can replace the stored power with a new wizard encounter attack power of your level or lower that you do not already know.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must wield a tome to benefit from this feature. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wizards of all builds appreciate this form of mastery because of the flexibility it allows them during combat.<br/><br/><b>Wand of Accuracy</b><br/>Once per encounter, you can use your Wand of Accuracy power.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Wand of Accuracy  Power</span>Wand of Accuracy</h1><p class="flavor"><i>This form of mastery is good for war wizards because it helps increase their accuracy with damaging powers.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Implement</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: you gain a bonus to a single attack roll equal to your Dexterity modifier. </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Requirement</b>: You must wield your wand.</p><br/></p><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>As a hybrid wizard, you’re not particularly durable, so you must choose your second hybrid class, as well as your powers, with care.<br/><br/>The swordmage shares the same key ability, but that class’s predilection for melee combat is at odds with the typical wizard’s preference for staying out of the fray. To keep up in melee, select a good mix of close attack powers and some feats that improve your survivability. Alternatively, focus your swordmage power selection on ranged powers and area powers and enter melee only as a last resort.<br/><br/>A cleric/wizard who has good Intelligence and Wisdom scores can safely and effectively remain in the back ranks while supporting allies with battlefield control and healing.<br/><br/>Adding the avenger class to your hybrid wizard allows you to surprise your enemies with the occasional deadly melee attack. Taking Armor of Faith through the Hybrid Talent feat gives you the boost to AC you need to stay close enough to deliver such an attack.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 155.</p>
