		<h1 class="player">Shaman</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. Your spirit companion bolsters and heals your nearby allies, and you can evoke other spirits to aid your allies and harm your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either defender or striker as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Primal.

They command powerful spirit guides, and through them lead their allies. These nature spirits bolster their allies’ attacks and offer protection and healing when needed.<br/>In a rite of passage or initiation, you pledged yourself to the spirits, to be their voice and hands in the world. Through ancient song and sacred ceremony, you have called a powerful spirit companion to your side. The primal spirits of nature affirm your will, guide the actions of your allies, and deal mighty attacks against your foes. You might be a venerable advisor to a tribal leader, a young traveler seeking to bring tales of a wider world back to your people, or a scholar devoted to the pursuit of nearly forgotten lore.<br/>The spirits and voices of nature guide your every step. Their power flows through you, calling you to lead, to fight, and to triumph.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A SHAMAN</H3>All shamans rely on Wisdom, and they also benefit from a high Constitution or Intelligence. You can choose any shaman powers you like for your character, though many shamans favor one of two different builds, letting their power choices be shaped by the form of their spirit companions.<br/><h3>ANIMIST SHAMAN</h3>Although the world is no longer green and alive, primal spirits still haunt the land. Mesas, crags, dunes, salt pans, siroccos, sandstorms—all contain spirits just as the forests and the oases do. These spirits born of the land are deeply infused with the powers of the elements, and they care little for other creatures. They can be sullen and wrathful entities, but you are able to bend them to your will.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how to call forth the desert spirits of sand and sun. The primal spirits you conjure exhibit the land’s characteristics. A spirit might shed rain droplets, erupt in blazing fire, or stir one’s hair as winds gust around it. Under your command, the spirits rage, unleashing their fury to smash and burn everything in their path. Through force of will, you compel the spirits, binding their power to your allies’ attacks or directing them to loose their anger against your enemies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an animist shaman, you command a spirit companion more elemental in nature than the spirit companions of other shamans. This elemental spirit might appear as a vortex of dust, a curtain of evaporating rain, a clattering gyre of pebbles, or any other desert phenomenon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need Wisdom for your attacks, so it should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next best score, because it helps boost the damage and benefits of your powers. A high Constitution increases your hit points and your Fortitude, so it should be your third-best score. Look for powers that let your allies make attacks, improve their attacks, or inhibit foes through zones and debilitating effects. Your secondary role is controller.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Elemental Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Spirit of Vigor<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Heal, Nature<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>spirit infusion, haunting spirits</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>scorching sands</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>dust storm binding</i><br/><br/><h3>BEAR SHAMAN</h3>You excel at protecting your allies and preserving life. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution so that you can better lend health to your allies. You’ll want a good  Intelligence score to improve your AC as well. Choose powers that help guard your allies against attacks, restore hit points, or provide temporary hit points. Your secondary role is defender.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Protector Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Shared Healing Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, Nature, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>defending strike, protecting strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>thunder bear’s warding</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>spirit of the healing flood</i><br/><br/><h3>EAGLE SHAMAN</h3>Your spirit companion soars above you and your allies, keeping a watchful eye for hidden enemies and drawing attacks to distant foes. Your role is to guide the attacks of your allies, using your spirit companion to concentrate your allies’ ranged attacks on enemies you want to slay or lock down.<br/><br/>You are at your best alongside allies who are armed with bows, javelins, slings, or powerful ranged magic. Rangers, warlocks, and other classes that have features or powers that let them target the nearest enemy thrive in your company, since your spirit companion lets them consider any enemy adjacent to it their nearest enemy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Watcher Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invigorating Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Heal, Insight, Nature, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>claws of the eagle, watcher’s strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>Stormhawk’s fury</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Great Watcher spirit</i><br/><br/><h3>PANTHER SHAMAN</h3>You wield the spirits’ power to see events before they unfold and to shape them as you like, guiding your allies’ actions in battle. Wisdom should be your best ability score, then Intelligence so that you can increase your allies’ tactical advantage. A high Constitution will improve your hit points and Fortitude. Choose powers that support your allies in melee, particularly allies who seek combat advantage and who relish quick movement. Your secondary role is striker.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Stalker Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Stalker Spirit Adept<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Heal, Nature, Perception<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>stalker’s strike, watcher’s strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>twin panthers</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>wrath of the spirit world</i><br/><br/><h3>WORLD SPEAKER SHAMAN</h3>You channel the living essence of the primal world and the cycles that define it, giving you command over the field of battle. Your spirit companion acts almost like a defender, preventing enemy movement around it while helping your allies move freely.<br/><br/>Your spirit companion is a being of stone and earth, summer and winter, wind and rain. Its appearance varies according to its nature and your desires. It might be vaguely humanoid or shaped somewhat like an animal. Most likely it changes its shape or its mix of earth, air, and water as the primal power flowing through it aligns with the cycles of the natural world.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: World Speaker Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Strengthening Spirit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Endurance, Nature<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>protecting strike, voice of battle</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>bramble ally</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>stone root spirit</i><br/><br/><h3>SHAMAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Each shaman has the powers call spirit companion, healing spirit, and speak with spirits. Your choice of Companion Spirit determines whether you have the power spirit’s fangs or spirit’s shield.<br/><br/><b>COMPANION SPIRIT</b><br/>As part of your initiation as a shaman, you acquired a spirit companion, an animal spirit that accompanies and assists you. Many shaman powers have the spirit keyword. Your spirit companion must be present when you use such a power.<br/>You gain the call spirit companion power, which allows you to call your spirit companion to your side. In addition, choose one of the following Companion Spirit options. Your choice provides you with a Spirit Boon as well as a special attack made through your spirit companion, and your choice determines one of your at-will attack powers. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain shaman powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Shaman Feature </span>Call Spirit Companion</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your soul reaches out to your spirit friend, which faithfully appears at your side.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Conjuration</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 20</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: Your spirit companion must not be present.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: You conjure your spirit companion in an unoccupied square in the burst.

When you take a move action, you can also move the spirit a number of squares equal to your speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit can be targeted by melee or ranged attacks, although it lacks hit points. If a single melee or ranged attack deals damage to the spirit equal to 10 + one-half your level or higher, the spirit disappears, and you take damage equal to 5 + one-half your level. Otherwise, the spirit is unaffected by the attack.</p><br/>Update (9/10/2010)<br/>Add the following Requirement entry above the Effect entry.<br/><br/></p><b>Elemental Spirit</b><br/>You draw on elemental spirits inhabiting the earth to give you strength and fuel the raw power of your evocations.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit Boon: Your allies gain a +2 bonus to saving throws while adjacent to your spirit companion.

Your powers fall into two broad categories: melee attacks your spirit companion makes, and ranged attacks. Your daily powers include a number of conjurations and zones, representing your ability to call on additional spirits for aid.<br/><br/>Religion<br/>Shamans draw their power from the primal power source and therefore don’t usually worship gods. They view themselves as agents—not servants or masters—of the spirits of nature and instruct others how to live their lives in harmony with those spirits. Like druids, shamans call on the spirits to witness significant events but don’t worship them.<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Shamans use totems carved to resemble the spirits they most commonly call upon, particularly their spirit companions. When you wield a magic totem, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of shaman powers and shaman paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 118.</p>
