		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Ranger</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Striker. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Martial. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged, military ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 6+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2.5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Acrobatics (Dex), Athletics (Str), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Hunter's Quarry (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Ranger Armor Proficiency, Ranger Combat Talent, Ranger Fighting Style.<br/></blockquote></p>You blend the hunter’s dogged pursuit of a quarry with other talents to become a formidable warrior. You might have learned your ranger powers as a young wanderer or an independent scout before taking up new skills. Alternatively, you might have been driven only recently to a life in the wilderness.<br/><br/>You retain the ranger’s damage-dealing capability. However, you initially give up the specialization of the ranger’s Fighting Style class feature.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID RANGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>HUNTER'S QUARRY (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the ranger class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit your quarry with a ranger power or a ranger paragon path power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Hunter's Quarry  Power</span>Hunter's Quarry</h1><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You can designate the nearest enemy to you that you can see as your quarry.<br/>Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level. If you can make multiple attacks in a round, you decide which attack to apply the extra damage to after all the attacks are rolled. If you have dealt Hunter’s Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>The hunter’s quarry effect remains active until the end of the encounter, until the quarry is defeated, or until you designate a different target as your quarry.<br/><br/>You can designate one enemy as your quarry at a time.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Hunter’s Quarry Extra Damage</th></tr><tr><td>1st–10th</td><td>+1d6</td></tr><tr><td>11th–20th</td><td>+2d6</td></tr><tr><td>21st–30th</td><td>+3d6</td></tr></table></p><br/>Addition (10/17/2008)<br/>Add the following sentence at the end of the second paragraph: “If you have dealt Hunter’s Quarry damage since the start of your turn, you cannot deal it again until the start of your next turn.”<br/><br/>Revision (7/16/2008)<br/>Replace the first sentence of the second paragraph with the following: “Once per round, when you hit your quarry with an attack, the attack deals extra damage based on your level.”<br/><br/>Revision (6/10/2008)<br/>In the first paragraph, replace “enemy nearest to you” with “nearest enemy to you that you can see.”<br/><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>RANGER ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor.<br/><br/><b>RANGER COMBAT TALENT</b><br/>When you select this option, you choose one of the following class features.<br/>Prime Shot: This class feature functions exactly as the ranger class feature.<br/>Running Attack: This class feature functions exactly as the ranger class feature.<br/><br/><b>Prime Shot (Hybrid)</b><br/>If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style.<br/><br/><b>Running Attack (Hybrid)</b><br/>This class feature replaces the Prime Shot class feature.<br/><br/>If you use a standard action that lets you move (such as a charge or the skirmish shot power), and you end that movement at least 2 squares away from where you began that move, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made as part of that standard action.<br/><br/><b>RANGER FIGHTING STYLE</b><br/>When you select this option, you can choose one of the following class features.<br/><br/><b>Archer Fighting Style (Hybrid)</b><br/>Because of your focus on ranged attacks, you gain Defensive Mobility as a bonus feat.<br/><br/><b>Beast Mastery (Hybrid)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the ranger class feature except that the beast takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses.<br/><br/><b>Hunter Fighting Style (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain Quick Draw as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites. In addition, you can sheathe a weapon as a free action and gain a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke by making a ranged attack.<br/><br/><b>Marauder Fighting Style (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain Two-Weapon Defense as a bonus feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to speed while you aren’t using a shield or a two-handed weapon.<br/><br/><b>Two-Blade Fighting Style (Hybrid)</b><br/>Because of your focus on two-weapon melee attacks, you can wield a one-handed weapon in your off hand as if it were an off-hand weapon. (Make sure to designate on your character sheet which weapon is main and which is off-hand.) In addition, you gain Toughness as a bonus feat.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>Fighter/ranger is an effective combination if you focus on melee powers designed for two weapons.<br/><br/>A ranger/rogue is undoubtedly a master damage-dealer. However, when combining the ranger and rogue classes, choose your powers carefully; many of these powers have weapon requirements that don’t match up well. For example, if you want to use ranged powers from both classes, you need a crossbow.<br/><br/>Even though the druid/ranger must balance multiple key abilities, this combination adds a fun primal flavor to the hybrid ranger.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>.</p>
