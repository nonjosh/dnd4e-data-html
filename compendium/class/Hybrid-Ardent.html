		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Ardent</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Leader. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Charisma, Constitution, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 6+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 2.5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 3.5<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Streetwise (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Ardent Mantle (Hybrid), Ardent Surge (Hybrid), Psionic Augmentation (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Ardent Armor Proficiency or Mantle Power.<br/></blockquote></p>Like most ardents, your psionic power comes from self-discovered potential rather than training. Why did you choose not to focus on honing your talent for harnessing emotion? Do you fear this ability, preferring to supplement it with the abilities of another class? Have you only begun to unlock this mysterious power?<br/><br/>As a hybrid ardent, you provide occasional but timely bursts of emotion to allies and enemies alike. However, by blending this power with the talents of another class, you give up the depth of your control over others’ emotions.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID ARDENT CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>ARDENT MANTLE (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the ardent class feature, except that you don’t gain the power associated with the mantle you choose.<br/><br/><b>Mantle of Clarity (Hybrid)</b><br/>You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier. In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks. (If a character is in the radius of more than one Mantle of Clarity, the bonuses are not cumulative. Only the highest ones apply to him or her.)<br/><br/><b>Mantle of Elation (Hybrid)</b><br/>You and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a bonus to damage rolls for opportunity attacks. The bonus equals your Constitution modifier.<br/>In addition, each ally within 5 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks.<br/><br/><b>ARDENT SURGE (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the ardent power ardent surge. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Feature </span>Ardent Surge</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You send a surge of powerful emotion that revives a faltering ally.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 16th level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mantle of Clarity</b>: The target gains a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mantle of Elation</b>: The target gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round. At 16th level, you can use this power three times per encounter, but only once per round.</p><br/></p><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the class feature, except that your power point total varies depending on your selection of powers. See “Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters” in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>ARDENT ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, and chainmail.<br/><br/><b>MANTLE POWER</b><br/>You gain the power associated with the Ardent Mantle option you chose.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Feature </span>Ardent Alacrity</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you take a hit, your emotional energy inspires your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>No Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You are bloodied by an attack</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Each target can use a free action either to shift 1 square or to move half his or her speed.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Ardent Feature </span>Ardent Outrage</h1><p class="flavor"><i>As you take a hit, your anger unbalances your foes.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>No Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You are bloodied by an attack</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Each target grants combat advantage until the start of your next turn.</p><br/></p>Suggested Combinations<br/>The ardent/bard is a great combination thematically,<br/>and the two classes’ roles and key ability scores match. It’s easy to imagine a character who taps into others’ emotions through both mental manipulation and song.<br/><br/>If you prefer to stay fully psionic, the ardent/battlemind delivers durability in battle and retains important leader functions.<br/><br/>One can easily compare the emotional discipline of an ardent to that required to be a paladin, and mixing these two classes creates an interesting hybrid. Charisma should be your best ability score, with Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom all vying for second place.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 139.</p>
