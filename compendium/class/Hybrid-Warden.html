		<h1 class="player">Hybrid Warden</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender. <br/><b>Power Source: </b>Primal. <br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Strength, Constitution, Wisdom<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide; heavy shields, light shields.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 8.5+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 3.5<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 4.5<br/><br/><b>Class Skills</b>: Athletics (Str), Dungeoneering (Wis), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Nature (Wis), Perception (Wis).<br/><br/><b>Class features: </b>Nature's Wrath (Hybrid)<br/><b>Hybrid Talent Options</b>: Font of Life or Warden’s Armored Might.<br/></blockquote></p>To stand strong against the defilers of the natural world, you have buttressed your primal tenacity with the capabilities of another class. These capabilities might be other ways of channeling primal spirits, or you might have decided that you can’t count on the spirits for all your strength.<br/><br/>As a hybrid warden, you can still punish foes for attacking your allies. However, because you divide your focus between two classes, you must give up some of the class’s innate durability (in the form of Font of Life and Guardian Might).<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID WARDEN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>NATURE'S WRATH (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the warden class feature, except that you mark only one adjacent enemy when you use the class feature’s marking ability.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>FONT OF LIFE</b><br/>At the start of your turn, you can make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. On a save, the effect immediately ends, preventing it from affecting you on your current turn. If you save against being stunned or dazed, you can act normally on your turn. If you save against ongoing damage, you avoid taking the damage.<br/>If you fail the saving throw, you still make a saving throw against the effect at the end of your turn.<br/><br/><b>WARDEN’S ARMORED MIGHT</b><br/>You gain the Guardian Might class feature. You also gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, light shields, and heavy shields.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The fighter/warden offers great durability and melee attacks, though this combination might need some help with AC; Warden’s Armored Might or Fighter Armor Proficiency are good fixes.<br/><br/>Adding the hybrid cleric gives the hybrid warden useful healing powers; Wisdom is likely your secondary ability.<br/><br/>Combining the hybrid warden with the hybrid ranger increases your damage output without hurting your AC too much.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 152.</p>
