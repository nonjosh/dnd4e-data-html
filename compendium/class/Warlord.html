Marshals draw from their experience and passion  to lend courage, skill, and hope to those under their command. A warlord forms the iron core of any unit of soldiers, uniting their purpose and bolstering their commitment to see the conflict to its conclusion.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marshal’s talents can come from many different aspects of personality or endeavor. Some depend on  their bravado, goading their companions to take risks in order to reap great rewards. Others have keen insight into their enemies’ minds. Some marshals specialize in hit-and-run tactics, and others are resourceful leaders who always have some trick up their sleeves. The most common marshals include those whose presence alone is  enough to bind disparate heroes together and the tactical savants who spot weaknesses and exploit them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshals develop specialized combat maneuvers called exploits. In their elementary form, they are strikes and commands designed to shift the battle toward a more favorable outcome. In addition to these exploits, marshals issue commands and orders that improve their allies’ performance. Some of these commands can restore health and vigor, while others make allies more alert and ready for new challenges.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most marshals have already had experience in the field, even if it came from leading a tiny expedition. Some are former military leaders who have relinquished their commands to seek their fortunes in the world. Others might have lost their units and be out for revenge against the enemy that brought them to ruin. Whatever the individual’s triumphs or defeats were before becoming an adventurer, every marshal has the ability to lead, and lead well.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A WARLORD (MARSHAL)</H3><br/><h3>BRAVURA WARLORD</h3>You lead through a combination of daring attacks and aggressive tactics. Using your powers is risky, but the rewards for success are great. You help your allies find the nerve to profit from bold maneuvers and punch into enemies head-on. Compared to other warlords, you’re oriented more toward handling heavy fighting yourself, and your attack powers rely mainly on Strength. Charisma is your second priority, for it lets you get away with your audacious stunts yet maintain the respect of your comrades. Mental acuity and quick reflexes in battle are valuable to any warlord, so Intelligence is also important to you. The Bravura Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Bravura (Human feat: Action Surge)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>brash assault, furious smash</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>luring focus</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>fearless rescue</i><br/><br/><h3>INSIGHTFUL WARLORD</h3>You lead through careful observation and a knack for predicting your enemies’ actions. In combat, you keep your eyes open and quickly adapt your plan to changing circumstances. You show your allies how to identify enemy weaknesses and exploit those flaws. You are skilled at demoralizing foes and are an expert at interrupting their actions by issuing quick commands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Insightful Presence, Canny Leader<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Lend Strength<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>direct the strike, intuitive strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>powerful warning</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>leader’s instincts</i><br/><br/><h3>INSPIRING WARLORD</h3>You lead by exhortation, encouragement, and inspiration. Your powers help your allies find new surges of courage and endurance within themselves, helping them heal, shrug off debilitating conditions, and defend themselves from attack. Your attack powers rely on Strength, so that should be your best ability score. The benefits you give your allies, though, depend almost entirely on Charisma, so make that second best. Intelligence is your best third choice, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to help your Reflex defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Charisma score.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Inspired Recovery (Human feat: Toughness)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Heal, History<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander's strike, furious smash</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>guarding attack</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>bastion of defense</i><br/><br/><h3>RESOURCEFUL WARLORD</h3>You don’t limit yourself to a particular set of tactics, instead adapting to the mistakes and openings your enemies provide and endeavoring to create opportunities. You lead through a diverse selection of shouted commands, ongoing stratagems, martial stances, and flexible plans. Allies can expect help in a wide variety of circumstances. As is typical for a warlord, Strength is your primary ability, but your powers make use of Intelligence and Charisma, encouraging you to pick and choose among the powers that other traditions have to offer. The Resourceful Presence class feature is designed to complement this build.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Resources (Human feat: Durable)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Diplomacy, Endurance, Heal<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>commander’s strike, opening shove</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>hammer formation</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>calculated assault</i><br/><br/><h3>SKIRMISHING WARLORD</h3>You scoff at the notion that war takes place on the front lines. Your talents are akin to the skills of archers, sneaks, and scouts. You recognize that their contributions are as vital as the efforts of melee combatants. You help allies by sharpening their timing, directing their maneuvers, and pointing out targets with your own ranged attacks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Archer Warlord, Skirmishing Presence<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Archer Captain<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Diplomacy, History<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>paint the bull’s eye, risky shot</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>race the arrow</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>inspiring shot</i><br/><br/><h3>TACTICAL WARLORD</h3>Your leadership takes the form of quick commands, cunning strategies, and tactical superiority. Your powers guide your allies to extra and more powerful attacks, as well as helping them move quickly in combat situations. You also assist your allies by moving your enemies around or knocking them prone. You use Strength for your attack powers, so make that your best ability score. Intelligence is secondary, because your Intelligence determines just how effective a leader you are. Charisma should be your third best score, so you can dabble in other warlord powers and to improve your Will defense. Select powers that make the best use of your high Intelligence score.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Tactical Assault (Human feat: Weapon Focus)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Endurance, Heal, History, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>viper’s strike, wolf pack tactics</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>warlord’s favor</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>lead the attack</i><br/><br/><h3>WARLORD (MARSHAL) CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>All warlords have these class features.<br/><br/><b>ARCHER WARLORD</b><br/>When you choose the Archer Warlord class feature, you lose proficiency with chainmail and light shields.<br/>You gain proficiency with military ranged weapons. In addition, when you make a ranged basic attack with a bow, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll and the damage roll.<br/><br/><b>BATTLEFRONT LEADER</b><br/>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain proficiency with heavy shields, and you gain the battlefront shift power.<br/><br/><b>CANNY LEADER</b><br/>This class feature replaces your Combat Leader class feature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and any ally within 10 squares of you who can see and hear you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks and Perception checks.<br/><br/><b>COMBAT LEADER</b><br/>You and each ally within 10 squares who can see and hear you gain a +2 power bonus to initiative.<br/><br/><b>COMMANDING PRESENCE</b><br/>Choose one of the following presence benefits below.<br/>The choice you make also provides bonuses to certain warlord powers. Individual powers detail the effects (if any) your Commanding Presence selection has on them.<br/><br/><b>Bravura Presence</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, the ally can choose to take advantage of this feature before the attack roll. If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn.<br/><br/><b>Insightful Presence</b><br/>When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the start of his or her next turn.<br/><br/><b>Inspiring Presence</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ally can see multiple warlord allies who have this class feature, the ally regains hit points from only one of them (the ally’s choice).<br/><br/><b>Resourceful Presence</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br/><br/><b>Skirmishing Presence</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack.<br/><br/><b>Tactical Presence</b><br/>When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the first attack roll of that attack. The bonus equals half your Intelligence modifier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If multiple warlord allies who have this class feature can see the ally, he or she gains the bonus from only one of them (the ally’s choice).<br/><br/><b>INSPIRING WORD</b><br/>Using the inspiring word power, warlords can grant their comrades additional resilience with nothing more than a shout of encouragement.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Warlord Feature </span>Inspiring Word</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call out to a wounded ally and offer inspiring words of courage and determination that invigorates your comrade.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.
