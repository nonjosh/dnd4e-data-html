What caused this deficiency? Did you flee or fail a rite of passage before its completion, weakening your link to the spirit world? Have you angered the spirits, causing their voices to quiet in your mind?<br/><br/>As a hybrid shaman, you have a spirit companion, as well as the ability to call on spirits for healing, but you give up many of your other talents to pursue a second class.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID SHAMAN CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>COMPANION SPIRIT (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the call spirit companion power.<br/><br/>In addition, choose one of the Companion Spirit options. You don’t gain the Spirit Boon or any of the powers granted by that choice, but you are considered to have the class feature for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br/><br/>Special: To select the at-will attack power associated with a Companion Spirit, you must have the appropriate spirit. For example, you can’t select the stalker’s strike power unless you have Stalker Spirit.<br/><br/><b>HEALING SPIRIT (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the shaman power healing spirit.  The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Shaman Feature </span>Healing Spirit</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call to the spirits on behalf of a wounded ally, closing wounds and filling your ally with vigor.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge.

You are aware of the constant presence of spirits that float at the edges of reality. You can focus your inner energy and open your mind to these spirits, letting them guide your actions or fill you with insights.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Shaman Feature </span>Speak with Spirits</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You commune with the spirits, letting them guide your words and actions.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: During this turn, you gain a bonus to your next skill check equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>SPIRIT BOON (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the Spirit Boon of the Companion Spirit option you chose.<br/><br/><b>SPIRIT'S POWER</b><br/>You gain the opportunity action power of the Companion Spirit option you chose.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>A druid/shaman has a wide array of options on the battlefield, including area attacks and healing effects.<br/><br/>The hybrid shaman seeking to add melee prowess would do well to consider the hybrid warden.<br/><br/>A melee-focused hybrid shaman might add the hybrid avenger, favoring Intelligence as a secondary ability. Would such a character be more loyal to the primal spirits or to the divine patron who schooled him or her in the arts of retribution?<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 150.</p>
