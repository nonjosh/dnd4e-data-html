How and where did you come to learn the intricacies of command? Did an early stint in the military or tutelage at the feet of a tribal leader inspire you to grasp the reins of authority? Or have you only recently donned the mantle of leadership?<br/><br/>As a hybrid warlord, you bring talents of combat leadership and healing to a group, although you give up the Commanding Presence class feature.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID WARLORD CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>INSPIRING WORD (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the warlord power inspiring word. The power functions as normal, except that you can use it only once per encounter.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Warlord Feature </span>Inspiring Word</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call out to a wounded ally and offer inspiring words of courage and determination that invigorates your comrade.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b>, <b>Martial</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can spend a healing surge and regain 1d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 6: 2d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: 3d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 16: 4d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 5d6 additional hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 26: 6d6 additional hit points.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power twice per encounter, but only once per round.

If the ally chooses to do so and the attack hits, the ally can either make a basic attack or take a move action after the attack as a free action. If the attack misses, the ally grants combat advantage to all enemies until the end of his or her next turn.<br/><br/><b>Insightful Presence (Hybrid)</b><br/>When any ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally gains a bonus to all defenses equal to half your Wisdom modifier or half your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn.<br/><br/><b>Inspiring Presence (Hybrid)</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action, that ally also regains hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br/><br/><b>Resourceful Presence (Hybrid)</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to take an extra action and uses the action to make an attack, that attack gains a bonus to damage equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits no target, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Charisma modifier.<br/><br/><b>Skirmishing Presence (Hybrid)</b><br/>When an ally who can see you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally can use a free action to shift a number of squares equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier before or after the attack.<br/><br/><b>Tactical Presence (Hybrid)</b><br/>When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack, the ally gains a bonus to the attack roll equal to one-half your Intelligence modifier.<br/><br/><b>WARLORD ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, and light shields.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The paladin/warlord and fighter/warlord combinations provide durability and melee control as well as healing.<br/><br/>For a barbarian/warlord, whatâ€™s more inspiring than charging into battle with a savage war cry? Make Charisma your second-highest ability score and pick powers from the two classes that take advantage of it.<br/><br/>A consummate leader, the cleric/warlord should focus on powers that use Strength and Charisma.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 154.</p>
