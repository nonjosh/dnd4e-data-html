The champions of these orders are avengers—deadly weapons in the hands of their gods, imbued with divine power through secret rites of initiation. In battle, avengers swear to execute divine vengeance, entering a mental state that gives them unerring focus on a single enemy.<br/><br/>As an avenger, you were trained in a monastery, initiated through secret rites, and imbued with the power to smite your god’s foes. You might be a disciple of Ioun, sworn to hunt and exterminate the minions of Vecna until you one day face the Maimed God. You could be an agent of the Raven Queen, bringing death to those who would defy your mistress. Or perhaps you serve Bahamut as an agent of justice, bringing ruin to tyrants and oppressors. The organizations devoted to your god might view you as a heretic or a hero, but you answer only to your god and to the vows you swore upon your initiation as an avenger.<br/><br/>Where will those vows lead you? One thing is certain: Doing the will of your god is never easy and never free of peril.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A AVENGER</H3>The three key ability scores for an avenger are Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence. Avengers typically choose feats, skills, and powers to complement the ability score related to their choice of Divine Censure.<br/><h3>COMMANDING AVENGER</h3>The commanding avenger build is based on the Censure of Unity. Once you have sworn your oath of enmity, you hope to surround your oath of enmity target with as many of your allies as possible. If the enemy seeks to flee, your powers enable you to compel it to face you. Alone you are powerful, but fighting alongside your comrades you are vengeance incarnate. Like other avengers, you should make Wisdom your highest ability score. Intelligence should be your second highest, followed by Dexterity.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Censure of Unity<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Focus<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Perception, Religion, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bond of censure, overwhelming strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>pass at arms</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>strength of many</i><br/><br/><h3>ISOLATING AVENGER</h3>After you swear an oath of enmity, you keep your enemy beside you and drive other foes away. Your powers help you isolate one creature at a time and bring it down quickly and let you take vengeance when that creature’s allies get past your defenses. Your attacks use Wisdom, so it should be your best ability score. Choose Intelligence for your secondbest score, reflecting your keen tactical awareness. Select powers that help you sequester your foe from its allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Censure of Retribution<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Toughness<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Intimidate, Religion, Streetwise<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bond of retribution, overwhelming strike</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>avenging echo</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>temple of light</i><br/><br/><h3>PURSUING AVENGER</h3>Once you swear an oath of enmity against an enemy, you pursue that creature wherever it goes. As much as it might try to escape your wrath, your powers let you follow it and punish it for trying to flee. Make Wisdom your highest ability score, and make Dexterity your second-best score to help you nimbly pursue your foe. Select powers that prevent your foe from moving away from you or that let you shift or teleport to the foe’s side.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Censure of Pursuit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Invigorating Pursuit<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Acrobatics, Perception, Religion, Stealth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>bond of pursuit, radiant vengeance</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i>angelic alacrity</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>oath of the final duel</i><br/><br/><h3>AVENGER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Each avenger has the power oath of enmity and the Channel Divinity powers abjure undead and divine guidance.<br/><br/><b>ARMOR OF FAITH</b><br/>The favor of your deity wards you from harm. While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren’t using a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to AC.<br/><br/><b>AVENGER'S CENSURE</b><br/>As an avenger, you train your mind, body, and soul toward one purpose: destroying the enemies of your faith. To that end, you gain divine aid in pursuing a single target, though the way you eliminate that enemy varies. Do you pin your foe down and keep other enemies away, or do you pursue your foe across the field of battle?<br/>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain avenger powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Censure of Pursuit</b><br/>If your oath of enmity target moves away from you willingly, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against the target equal to 2 + your Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn. The bonus increases to 4 + your Dexterity modifier at 11th level and 6 + your Dexterity modifier at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>Censure of Retribution</b><br/>When any enemy other than your oath of enmity target hits you, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target equal to your Intelligence modifier until the end of your next turn. This bonus is cumulative.<br/><br/><b>Censure of Unity</b><br/>You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target for each ally adjacent to that target. The bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level.<br/><br/><b>CHANNEL DIVINITY</b><br/>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.<br/><br/><b>OATH OF ENMITY</b><br/>Your god gives you the power to strike down your chosen prey. You gain the oath of enmity power.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Avenger Feature </span>Oath of Enmity</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You focus your wrath on a single foe, giving your attacks against it extraordinary accuracy.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One enemy you can see in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: When you make a melee attack against the target and the target is the only enemy adjacent to you, you make two attack rolls and use either result. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the target drops to 0 hit points, at which point you regain the use of this power.<br/>If another effect lets you roll twice and use the higher result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack. If an effect forces you to roll twice and use the lower result when making an attack roll, this power has no effect on that attack either.<br/>If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this power, you reroll both dice.</p><br/></p>AVENGER OVERVIEW<br/>Swinging a melee weapon in combat, you wield devastating divine power against your foes. You have a secondary assortment of ranged and close implement powers that let you draw your foes closer to you, teleport near them, or scorch them with divine wrath from afar.<br/><br/>Religion<br/>An avenger might serve any deity, but an avenger is more likely to worship an unaligned deity than a god of good or lawful good. Avengers of Ioun are among the most common, fighting a war of knowledge against the servants of Vecna. Unaligned avengers often revere the Raven Queen, Erathis, or Sehanine, and evil avengers often serve Asmodeus, Lolth, Tiamat, or Zehir.<br/><br/>Races<br/>Elves and razorclaw shifters make excellent pursuing avengers, and devas excel as isolating avengers. Many avengers are human, because most of the hidden monasteries that produce avengers are of human origin.<br/><br/><h3>IMPLEMENTS</h3>Like clerics and paladins, avengers use holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. When they make their own holy symbols, the symbols are often different in some detail from the symbols used by other characters, yet avengers can use the same holy symbols used by clerics and paladins.<br/>When you wear or hold a magic holy symbol, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of avenger powers and avenger paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, you can still use these powers.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 32.</p>
