What led you to meld the psion’s powers of mental control with the powers of another class? Have you discovered a secret connection between psionics and another power source? Or do your mental talents represent the ace up your sleeve, an unexpected well of tricks that supplement your other abilities?<br/><br/>As a hybrid psion, you forgo that class’s innate talent with rituals and minor psionic powers to gain features and powers from a second class.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID PSION CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>DISCIPLINE FOCUS (HYBRID)</b><br/>Choose a Discipline Focus option. If you choose Telekinesis Focus, you gain the far hand power. If you choose Telepathy Focus, you gain the send thoughts power.<br/><br/><b>Telekinesis Focus (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the power far hand.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Psion Feature </span>Far Hand</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You lift an object into the air with the power of your mind.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One object that weighs 20 pounds or less and isn’t carried by another creature</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it. When you move the target with this power, you can cause the target to remain aloft until the end of your next turn. If you are holding the target when you use this power, you can put it into a container that’s on your person and simultaneously move a second object that you’re carrying to your hand. The second object then becomes the target if it weighs 20 pounds or less.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: You either move the target to a square within range or manipulate it.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Telepathy Focus (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the power send thoughts.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Psion Feature </span>Send Thoughts</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You communicate telepathically with a creature.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 20</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature that shares a language with you</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You send a mental message of 25 words or fewer to the target.

If you have Telepathy Focus, you gain the distract power.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/>The psion/wizard is a controller extraordinaire, using a high Intelligence to rain down arcane and psionic destruction on enemies.<br/><br/>A bard/psion combines discipline with guile to outfox enemies just long enough to defeat them. You’ll want high Intelligence and Charisma scores.<br/><br/>The psion/warlock grasps for power from all sources, whether by mastering your own psionic potential or by drawing on bargains with otherworldly entities. With good Intelligence and Charisma scores, you should be able to gather all the power you need.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 147.</p>
