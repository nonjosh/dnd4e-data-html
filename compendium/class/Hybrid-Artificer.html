Your expertise is spotty, however, with many gaps that a true artificer might scoff at. Of course, you know plenty of tricks beyond the skill of that artificer.<br/><br/>Why does your knowledge have such gaps? Do you lack the discipline or talent to master some of the formulas and recipes of the artificer? Or have you recognized that technical skills must be supplemented with other abilities?<br/><br/>As a hybrid artificer, you retain some of the artificer’s healing ability, but you trade away magic item manipulation in exchange for another class’s abilities.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>HEALING INFUSION (HYBRID)</b><br/>This class feature functions as the artificer class feature, except that you can create only one healing infusion at the end of each extended rest.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Artificer Feature </span>Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You use the magic of your infusion to heal the wounds of your target.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter (Special)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5 (10 at 11th level, 15 at 21st level)</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: You or one ally in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target regains hit points equal to its healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier, and you expend an infusion crafted with your Healing Infusion class feature.<br/>Level 6: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 2.<br/>Level 11: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 4.<br/>Level 16: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 6.<br/>Level 21: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 8.<br/>Level 26: Healing surge value + your Wisdom modifier + 10.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use two Healing Infusion powers per encounter, but only one per round.

You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.<br/><br/><b>Augment Energy</b><br/>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended. The wielder of the implement or the weapon can use a free action after making an attack roll to expend the reservoir of energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. An implement or a weapon can be augmented only once per day in this way.<br/><br/><b>Impart Energy</b><br/>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. An item can be recharged only once per day in this way.<br/><br/><b>ARCANE REJUVENATION</b><br/>Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies’ magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer’s allies uses a magic item’s daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/><br/>The artificer/wizard is a master of arcane secrets, using Intelligence to attack enemies and heal allies.<br/><br/>The artificer/swordmage might prefer melee powers. Choose Constitution as your secondary ability score to maximize synergy between the two classes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>The artificer/warlock can be an effective mix of leadership and damage-dealing, particularly if you set Intel-ligence and Constitution as your two highest ability scores.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 139.</p>
