Do your druid powers stem from an innate but undeveloped link to primal spirits? Or have you just begun to explore the mysteries of nature after a life spent in other pursuits? <br/>As a hybrid druid, you can assume beast form and likely know powers useful in that form. However, you sacrifice some connections to the natural world—including Primal Aspect and Ritual Casting—to explore another class’s talents.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID DRUID CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>WILD SHAPE</b><br/>As a druid, you have the ability to channel the primal energy of beasts into your physical form and transform into a beast. You have an at-will power, wild shape, that allows you to assume the form of a beast, and many druid powers have the beast form keyword and therefore can be used only while you are in beast form.<br/>The wild shape power lets you assume a form of your size that resembles a natural or a fey beast, usually a four-legged mammalian predator such as a bear, a boar, a panther, a wolf, or a wolverine. Your beast form might also be an indistinct shape of shadowy fur and claws, an incarnation of the Primal Beast of which all earthly beasts are fractured images. You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape, and that form has no effect on your game statistics.<br/>Your choice of Primal Aspect might suggest a specific form you prefer to assume, and certain beast form powers specify changes to your form when you use them. You might also resemble a more exotic beast when you're in beast form: a reptile such as a rage drake or a crocodile, or a fantastic beast such as an owlbear or a bulette.<br/><br/><p><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level">Druid Feature </span>Wild Shape</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You assume an aspect of the Primal Beast or return to your  humanoid form.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Polymorph</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to beast form or vice versa. When you change from beast form back to your humanoid form, you can shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can’t use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose a specific form whenever you use wild shape to change into beast form. The beast form is your size, resembles a natural beast or a fey beast, and normally doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your beast form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your beast form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your beast form is inaccessible.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power once per round.</p><br/>Update (11/17/2010)<br/>In the first paragraph, replace the third sentence with the following text.<br/>"While you are in beast form, you can’t use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers."<br/><br/></p><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>DRUID ARMOR PROFICIENCY</b><br/>You gain proficiency with leather armor and hide armor.<br/><br/><b>PRIMAL ASPECT</b><br/>Druidic lore speaks of the Primal Beast, the first spirit of the world’s noble predators. A formless thing of shadows, fur, feathers, and claws, this creature appears in many druids’ visions, and they speak of channeling the Primal Beast when using their wild shape and beast form powers. As a druid, you choose which aspect of the Primal Beast you most strongly manifest with your powers.<br/>Choose one of these options. Your choice provides bonuses to certain druid powers, as detailed in those powers.<br/><br/><b>Primal Guardian</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to determine your AC.<br/><br/><b>Primal Predator</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your speed.<br/><br/><b>Primal Swarm</b><br/>While you are in beast form and not wearing heavy armor, melee attacks and ranged attacks deal less damage to you. When you take damage from either type of attack, the damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier.<br/><br/><b>Primal Wrath</b><br/>While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls of druid attack powers and druid paragon path attack powers that have the cold, fire, lightning, or thunder keywords.<br/><br/>Selecting Druid Powers<br/><br/>Despite automatically gaining the wild shape power, a hybrid druid doesn’t come with beast form powers; you must select them from your limited array of druid powers.<br/>At 1st level, you should consider selecting a beast form power as your lone druid at-will power. You can use your other at-will power in humanoid form even if that power isn’t a druid power. (Human hybrid druids can afford to pick up both a beast form  and a nonbeast form druid at-will power.)<br/>If you don’t have any beast form powers, you’re wasting wild shape, so include beast form powers among your attack powers and utility powers. Having a beast form power you can use in every encounter makes your wild shape more valuable.<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/>The druid/shaman is an ideal combination of primal classes, mixing the druid’s control and melee powers with the shaman’s leadership. <br/><br/>A druid/invoker mixes powers and features from two different Wisdom-based controller classes and can offer an interesting character background: What brought you to mesh the ancient power of the gods with the might of primal spirits?<br/><br/>Hybrid druids who want to increase their deadliness in melee should consider the avenger, ranger, and rogue classes.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 143.</p>
