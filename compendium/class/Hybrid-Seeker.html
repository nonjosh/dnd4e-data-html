What keeps you from giving yourself fully to the primal spirits? Do you fear loss of control? Do you mistrust their motives? Or are you simply not spiritually strong enough to hold the power they offer?<br/><br/>As a hybrid seeker, you give up some battlefield control ability in exchange for features and powers of a second class.<br/><br/><h3>HYBRID SEEKER CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/><b>INEVITABLE SHOT (HYBRID)</b><br/>You gain the seeker power inevitable shot. The power functions as normal, except that it is triggered only by ranged attacks from seeker powers and seeker paragon path powers.<br/><br/><b>SEEKER'S BOND (HYBRID)</b><br/>Choose one of the Seeker’s Bond options. You gain only the power associated with that option, and you can use the power only once per day. You are also considered to have that option for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br/><br/><b>Bloodbond (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the encaging spirits power. You can use the power only once per day. You are also considered to have Bloodbond for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Seeker Feature </span>Encaging Spirits</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call on protecting spirits to harry your foes.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Level 11</b>: Close burst 2</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Level 21</b>: Close burst 3</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You push each target 1 square, and each target is slowed until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Spiritbond (Hybrid)</b><br/>You gain the spirits’ rebuke power.  You can use the power only once per day. You are also considered to have Spiritbond for the purpose of meeting prerequisites and using the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Seeker Feature </span>Spirits' Rebuke</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You dodge your enemy’s attack, and spirits coalesce around you to punish your attacker.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Primal</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must be wielding a light thrown or a heavy thrown weapon.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy misses you with a melee attack</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target takes 1[W] + your Strength modifier damage, and you push it 1 square.</p><br/></p><br/><br/><b>Hybrid talent Options</b><br/>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br/><br/><b>TRUE SEEKER'S BOND</b><br/>You gain the rest of the benefits of the Seeker’s Bond option you chose (except that you can still use the power only once per day).<br/><br/>Suggested Combinations<br/>The best hybrid combination for this class is ranger/seeker, creating a ranged attack specialist. Your Wisdom and Dexterity scores should be equally high, with Strength a good third choice.<br/><br/>The rogue/seeker can pick up ranged attacks from both classes, using thrown daggers or a hand crossbow rather than a longbow. Ability score assignment is difficult; you’ll need high Wisdom and Dexterity scores, and your secondary ability options require some tough choices.<br/><br/>The fighter/seeker can be a mighty warrior. Strength and Wisdom should be your top ability scores.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 150.</p>
