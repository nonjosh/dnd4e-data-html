		<h1 class="player">Battlemind</h1><p class="flavor"><b>CLASS TRAITS</b><blockquote><b>Role: </b>Defender. You are tough and fast, while your mastery of psionic magic allows you to outwit your foes. Depending on your choice of class features and powers, you lean toward either controller or striker as a secondary role.<br/><b>Power Source: </b>Psionic. You are a psionic warrior, a weapon master who combines physical might and a cunning intellect.<br/><b>Key Abilities: </b>Constitution, Wisdom, Charisma<br/><br/><b>Armor Proficiencies: </b>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale; heavy shields, light shields.<br/><b>Weapon Proficiencies: </b>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.<br/><b>Bonus to Defense: </b>+2 Will.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points at 1st Level</b>: 15+ Constitution Score.<br/><b>Hit Points per Level Gained</b>: 6<br/><b>Healing Surges per Day</b>: 9+ Constitution Modifier.<br/><br/><b>Trained Skills</b>: From the class skills list below, choose 3 trained skills at 1st level.<br/><i>Class Skills</i>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha).<br/><br/><b>Build Options: </b>Harrier Battlemind, Quick Battlemind, Resilient Battlemind, Wild Battlemind.<br/><b>Class features: </b>Psionic Augmentation, Psionic Defense, Psionic Study.<br/></blockquote></p>As wanderers, mercenaries, and adventurers, battleminds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents. Battleminds possess a potent combination of psionic and physical skill, allowing them to use their magic to manipulate and deceive their foes even as their fighting skill lets them carve a swath through enemy ranks. Battleminds tend to be bold and sometimes arrogant, an attitude earned through bringing ruin to enemies over the course of many conflicts.<br/><br/>You might not share your fellow battleminds’ arrogance, but you do have access to an array of combat abilities that let you manipulate, baffle, and defeat your enemies. Your mind is as deadly as your weapon, and with the aid of your psionic magic, your body can turn aside attacks as effectively as a suit of plate armor can.<br/><br/>Let those who would stand against your might quiver in terror when you approach, for you are a battlemind, and supremacy in combat is your birthright.<br/><br/><H3>CREATING A BATTLEMIND</H3>Battleminds rely on Constitution, Charisma, and Wisdom for their powers. You can choose any powers you like, but many battleminds choose powers that complement their choice of combat style.<br/><h3>HARRIER BATTLEMIND</h3>As a harrier battlemind, you move with ease across the battlefield, whether taking the fight to your enemies or falling back to draw them closer to you. Choose powers that facilitate movement, with teleportation powers being the most important. Your secondary role is controller, which can be strengthened by area powers that manipulate or hamper your opponents. Your feat selection should improve your defenses and mobility.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Constitution your highest ability score. Dexterity should be your second-highest score, getting you into the fight quickly and letting you avoid heavy armor to keep moving at full speed in combat. A high Wisdom allows you to improve your battlefield awareness, and Charisma remains important for the many battlemind disciplines that rely on that skill.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Persistent Harrier<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Harrying Step<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>renewed focus, worldslipping advance</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Persistent Harrier<br/>Feat: Harrying Step<br/>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Insight<br/>At-Will Powers: renewed focus, worldslipping advance<br/>Daily Power: accelerating strike</i><br/><br/><h3>QUICK BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to make yourself faster, increasing your speed and agility in combat. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Charisma to reflect your ability to project your psionic power into the world. Wisdom should be your third-best ability. For daily powers, consider those that grant new opportunity actions to you, ensuring that your foes can’t outmaneuver you.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Speed of Thought<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Improved Speed of Thought<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>demon dance, whirling defense</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Speed of Thought<br/>Feat: Improved Speed of Thought<br/>Skills: Arcana, Athletics, Insight<br/>At-Will Powers: demon dance, whirling defense<br/>Daily Power: steel unity strike</i><br/><br/><h3>RESILIENT BATTLEMIND</h3>You use your psionic power to transform your body, altering it to take on the qualities of iron or stone, or to transform your weapon so it hits harder or bypasses your foes’ protections. Make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom to reflect the strong mental control you have over your physical state. Charisma is a good third choice. For daily powers, consider those that alter your form and provide additional augmentations you can use for your other powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Battle Resilience<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Deceptive Mind<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>iron fist, bull’s strength</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Battle Resilience<br/>Feat: Deceptive Mind<br/>Skills: Arcana, Endurance, Intimidate<br/>At-Will Powers: iron fist, bull’s strength<br/>Daily Power: aspect of elevated harmony</i><br/><br/><h3>WILD BATTLEMIND</h3>The use of psionic power is widespread on Athas, and many warriors take up the career of the battlemind. Battleminds are hardy and cunning, two characteristics essential to survival on Athas. Self-taught or informally trained, wild battleminds rely on instinct. These battleminds channel raw psionic energy fueled by their untamed emotions. They often develop their powers as a result of a traumatic or a dangerous experience that triggers their psionic talent as a defense mechanism.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild battlemind is the most common type of battlemind on Athas. These individuals live in the wastes or the slums, growing up without the privileges afforded to nobles who receive formal training in the Way. The aggressive, powerful attacks of a wild battlemind reflect the brutality of life under the red sun. It’s not unusual for a wild battlemind to end up as a gladiator in the arenas of Athas.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly and unpredictable wild battleminds are born to be warriors. From an early age, they learn the ways of psionic combat through trial and error. They often craft their own weapons, chipping away at shards of obsidian or lashing together bones and teeth. They favor two-handed weapons, which they can use to great effect in battle.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other battleminds, you should make Constitution your primary ability score, because you use it to make your psionic attacks. Choose Charisma as your secondary ability score. Charisma improves your Wild Focus class feature and enhances many of your battlemind powers. Select Wisdom as your tertiary ability score if you want to dabble in powers from other battlemind builds.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Class Feature</b>: Wild Focus<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Feat</b>: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer’s Vault™ supplement)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Skills</b>: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested At-Will Powers</b>: <i>concussive spike, whirling defense</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Encounter Power</b>: <i></i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suggested Daily Power</b>: <i>Feature: Wild Focus<br/>Feat: Weapon Proficiency (choose a two-handed superior melee weapon, such as the execution axe or the fullblade, both of which appear in the Adventurer’s Vault™ supplement)<br/>Skills: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate<br/>At-Will Powers: concussive spike, whirling defense<br/>Daily Power: corona of floating force</i><br/><br/><h3>BATTLEMIND CLASS FEATURES</h3><br/>Battleminds have the following class features.<br/><br/><b>PSIONIC AUGMENTATION</b><br/>Through discipline and careful study, you have mastered a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. You know a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which you can pour as much or as little psionic energy as you choose. You channel psionic energy into a reservoir of personal power—represented in the game as power points—that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Because of this class feature, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>At-Will Attack Powers: At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don’t start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the augmentable keyword.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level, you choose a new at-will attack power from this class. At 7th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both powers must be augmentable and from this class.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Power Points: You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd and 7th level, 1 additional power point at 13th level, and 2 additional power points at 17th, 21st, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>At-Will Attack Powers</th><th>Power Points</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Choose two</td><td>Gain 2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Choose one</td><td>Gain 2 (4 total)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (6 total)</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 1 (7 total)</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (9 total)</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>—</td><td>Gain 2 (11 total)</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (13 total)</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Replace one</td><td>Gain 2 (15 total)</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The Augmentable keyword<br/><br/>A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br/><br/>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power’s effects.<br/><br/>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, "Augment 1" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br/><br/>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can’t, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br/><br/>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as "Hit" or "Effect," that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br/><br/>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn’t have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br/><br/>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.<br/><br/><b>PSIONIC DEFENSE</b><br/>Three powers—battlemind’s demand, blurred step, and mind spike—help you maintain tactical superiority in combat. You can use these psionic powers to demand your enemies’ attention, follow them if they try to avoid you, and punish them if they attack your allies. This combination of mental compulsion and psionic enhancement of your own capabilities makes you a force to be reckoned with in battle.<br/><br/><b>PSIONIC STUDY</b><br/>Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.<br/><br/><b>Battle Resilience</b><br/>You gain the battle resilience power, which reflects your ability to use your psionic power to bend your own body to protect yourself.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Battle Resilience</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You steel yourself for battle, girding yourself against your foe’s initial assault.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An attack hits or misses you for the first time during an encounter</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/>Level 11: Resist 6 + your Wisdom modifier.<br/>Level 21: Resist 9 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Persistent Harrier</b><br/>You gain the persistent harrier power, which reflects the ease with which you can outmaneuver your opponents.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Persistent Harrier</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You slip the bonds of space to strike back at even a distant opponent.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b>, <b>Teleportation</b>, <b>Weapon</b><br/><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> weapon</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy hits or misses you with an attack for the first time during an encounter</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy</p><p class="flavor"><b>Special</b>: You can attack the target with this melee attack even if the target is outside your melee reach.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Constitution vs. AC</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1[W] + Constitution modifier damage, and you teleport to a square adjacent to the enemy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 2[W] + Constitution modifier damage.</p><br/>Update (8/16/2011)<br/>Changed in September update.<br/><br/></p><br/><b>Speed of Thought</b><br/>You gain the speed of thought power, which allows you to be always ready for a fight.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Speed of Thought</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You move in the blink of an eye, reaching your foes before they can draw their weapons.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You roll initiative</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You move a number of squares equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power even if you’re surprised.</p><br/></p><br/><b>Wild Focus</b><br/>You gain the wild focus power, which reflects the raw telekinetic power you wield in combat.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Battlemind Feature </span>Wild Focus</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Using a surge of telekinetic power, you yank an enemy toward you, forcing it to fight.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Psionic</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: An enemy starts its first turn during an encounter.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: The triggering enemy in the burst</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You pull the target a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier and mark it until the end of your next turn.</p><br/></p><br/>BATTLEMIND OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Characteristics: Your heavy armor allows you to take on your enemies’ attacks without fear, and your melee attacks that are augmented by psionic magic let you control your enemies like puppets and set them up for defeat. You excel at controlling the battle line and forcing enemies to fight you while your allies wreak havoc.<br/><br/>Religion: Battleminds who live up to this class’s renowned arrogance rarely pray to the gods, and stories abound of battleminds whose ill luck could be placed at the feet of their impiety. Those battleminds who do follow the gods typically revere Kord for his martial skill and strength, Bahamut for his practice of justice, or Ioun for being the originator of psionic magic.<br/><br/>Races: Half-elves are ideal quick battleminds, channeling their natural Charisma into psionic alacrity. Goliaths’ sheer physical power makes them well suited for this class, and many gnome and tiefling warriors are drawn to the guile and trickery of some battlemind powers.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 42.</p>
