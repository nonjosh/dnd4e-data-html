If you gain additional Channel Divinity powers by selecting divinity feats, you can use them in place of the power granted by this feat, but that doesn’t change your normal limit on uses of Channel Divinity.<br/><b>Special</b>: This feat counts as a class-specific multiclass feat for the chosen class.<br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949823" target="_new">Divine Power</a>, page(s) 144.</p>
