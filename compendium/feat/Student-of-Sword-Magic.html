		<h1 class="player">Student of Sword Magic</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Heroic Tier</b><br/><b>Prerequisite</b>: Swordmage<br/><b>Benefit</b>: You have a spellbook in which you record your swordmage spells.<br/>When you choose this feat, select a second swordmage daily attack power for each level at which you already know a swordmage daily attack power, and add those powers to your spellbook. After an extended rest, you can prepare a number  of daily spells according to what you can cast per day for your level. You canâ€™t prepare the same spell twice.<br/>Whenever you learn a new level of swordmage daily attack powers, add two different swordmage daily attack spells of that level to your spellbook.<br/>If you retrain a daily swordmage attack power, you replace only one of your two choices for that level. If you replace the power with a power from a different class (through multiclassing) or a swordmage daily attack power of a higher level, you replace both spell choices with the new power or powers.<br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 136.</p>
