		<h1 class="player">Lasting Frost</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Paragon Tier</b><br/><b>Prerequisite</b>: 11th level<br/><b>Benefit</b>: Once per turn, the first target you hit with a power that has the cold keyword gains vulnerable 5 cold after the attack. The vulnerability lasts until the end of your next turn.<br/></p><br/>Update (2/8/2010)<br/>On the Benefit line, replace “Any” with “Once per turn, the first.” Also, replace “until the end of your next turn” with “after the attack. The vulnerability lasts until the end of your next turn.” This change limits the potency of this feat when used with close attacks and area attacks. The revision mitigates damage from builds focused on capitalizing on cold vulnerability. It also clarifies that the timing of the effect occurs after the attack is completely resolved.<br/><br/>Revision (7/28/2008)<br/>Replace "cold 5" with "5 cold" in Benefits line.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 203.</p>
