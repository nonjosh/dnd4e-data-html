You can perform the Bloom ritual in 5 minutes, including during a short rest, and you need no ritual book to do so. Performing the ritual during a short rest does not prevent you from resting. If a creature in the ritualâ€™s affected area spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier with each healing surge.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you can perform the Bloom ritual once per day without expending ritual components.<br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/412" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 412</a>.</p>
