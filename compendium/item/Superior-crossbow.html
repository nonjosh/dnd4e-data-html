		<h1  class="player">Superior crossbow</h1><br/>Superior two-handed ranged weapon<br/>Cost: 30 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d10<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 20/40<br/>Weight: 6 lb.<br/><br/>This crossbow appears similar to a traditional crossbow, but it has knobs and dials that allow the weapon to be fine-tuned for greater accuracy.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Load Minor (<i>Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Crossbow (<i>Essentially a small metal bow mounted on a stock and equipped with a mechanical trigger, a crossbow is a point-and-shoot projectile weapon. Crossbows are popular because they require little training to master, yet the heavy pull of the metal bow gives them substantial power.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 10.</p>
