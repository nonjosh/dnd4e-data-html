		<h1  class="player">Lancing dagger</h1><br/>Superior <br/>Cost: 15 gp<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>A lancing dagger is made of metal drawn from tall mountains and features two jagged edges, giving it the shape of a lightning bolt.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Light Thrown (<i>A basic attack with a light thrown weapon uses your Dexterity. Light thrown weapons don’t deal as much damage as heavy thrown weapons, but some powers let you hurl several of them at once or in rapid succession.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Empowered Crit (<i>When you score a critical hit with an empowered crit implement, the attack deals 1d10 extra damage. The extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 21st level.</i>).<br/>Energized (lightning) (<i>When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement’s damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 49, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
