Each arm looks like the head and neck of a snarling dragon, and each of its four feet is like a draconic claw grasping a sphere.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Wondrous Item</b></p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">A creature seated in the throne is attacked each round: +38 vs. Will; the target is restrained and dominated until the end of its next turn. If a creature sits in Thakorsil’s Seat willingly, the attack automatically hits. The creature can take no action other than to stay seated, although it can speak and think. While in the Seat, the creature cannot be located by powers or rituals used by a caster of lower than 30th level.<br/></p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218287200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide</a>, page(s) 58.</p>
