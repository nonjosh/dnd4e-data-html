It takes opportunity attacks against its former allies but not against you and your allies. As a free action on the target's turn, you can command the target to make a basic attack (using its standard action for its turn) against any other target or targets of your choice. However, you cannot command the target to use any of its other powers.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 175.</p>
