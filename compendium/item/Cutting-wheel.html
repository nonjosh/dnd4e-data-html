		<h1  class="player">Cutting wheel</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 10 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>Originating from the mysterious lands of Sarlona, the cutting wheel is a bladed disk with a guarded handle at one side. Many wheels feature spikes or barbs to protect the wielder’s hand.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Defensive (<i>A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
