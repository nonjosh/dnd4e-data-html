		<h1  class="player">Short spear</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 2 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>Although this weapon often serves the same role as a spear, it is more handy for the smaller races. It can also be used as a thrown weapon, unlike a full-sized spear.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Light Thrown (<i>A basic attack with a light thrown weapon uses your Dexterity. Light thrown weapons don’t deal as much damage as heavy thrown weapons, but some powers let you hurl several of them at once or in rapid succession.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Spear (<i>Consisting of a stabbing head on the end of a long shaft, a spear is great for lunging attacks.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
