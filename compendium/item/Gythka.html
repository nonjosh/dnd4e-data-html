		<h1  class="player">Gythka</h1><br/>Superior double melee weapon<br/>Cost: 25 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d8<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 9 lb.<br/><br/>Each end of this thri-kreen staff has a small, crescent-shaped blade with a centered stabbing tine. The secondary end of this double weapon is light enough to be used as an off-hand weapon. A gythka can be thrown like a javelin.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Defensive (<i>A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.</i>).<br/>Heavy Thrown (<i>You hurl a thrown weapon from your hand, rather than using it to loose a projectile. A basic attack with a heavy thrown weapon uses your Strength.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Spear (<i>Consisting of a stabbing head on the end of a long shaft, a spear is great for lunging attacks.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
