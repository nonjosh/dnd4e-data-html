After a treatment of snake oil, the treated skin peels away from the body, leaving behind soft, smooth flesh. Full-body treatments of snake oil have been known to reverse the cosmetic effects of the aging process, removing an entire year of wear from the body with each treatment. The cost of doing so is a reasonable option only for the wealthy. Even though the treatment removes the physical effects of aging on the skin, as well as some of the associated aches and pains, all other bodily processes continue to age normally. Death cannot be put off by using snake oil, a fact seldom conveyed by those who sell it. <p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 135.</p>
