		<h1  class="player">Garrote</h1><br/>Superior two-handed  weapon<br/>Cost: 1 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>This strangling tool is a length of wire or knotted rope with handles at either end. The only attacks that you can make with a garrote are ones that require or allow its use. Also, if you are holding a garrote in both hands, you can use the grab action even without a hand free. If the grab hits, the target takes 1[W] damage from the garrote.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Garrote (<i></i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/373" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 373</a>, page(s) 22, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 19.</p>
