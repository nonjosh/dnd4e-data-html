		<h1  class="player">Zadatl</h1><br/>Superior two-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 30 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d8<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 7 lb.<br/><br/>Also known as the pincer staff, this Draji polearm was developed to grab and control targets that might be captured for later sacrifice. It consists of a long haft with a crossbar at the end with two pincerlike tines attached. The pincers are often actual mandible pieces from giant insects.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Reach (<i>With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Polearm (<i>Polearms are weapons mounted at the end of long hafts. All polearms also fall into another category of weapon, usually axe, heavy blade, or spear. Polearms are reach weapons.</i>).<br/>Spear (<i>Consisting of a stabbing head on the end of a long shaft, a spear is great for lunging attacks.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/391" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 391</a>.</p>
