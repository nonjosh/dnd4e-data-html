The gauntlet does not occupy its square. While the gauntlet is floating, you can perform actions with it as if your hand were still in it, such as opening doors, picking up objects, and making Thievery checks. You cannot use the floating gauntlet to make attacks or to perform any action requiring two hands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can take a move action to move the gauntlet up to 10 squares, and it must end the move within 10 squares of you. If the gauntlet is adjacent to you, you can return it to your hand as a minor action. If you drop below 1 hit point or remove the gauntlet that youâ€™re wearing, the floating gauntlet returns to your hand.</p><h2 class="mihead">Utility Power (Teleportation) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Move Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Requirement:</i> One of the gauntlets must be floating.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> You teleport, swapping positions with the floating gauntlet.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 65.</p>
