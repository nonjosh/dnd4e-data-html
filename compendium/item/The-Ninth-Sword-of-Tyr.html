Each sword can have only one bonded wielder at a time, and only a bonded wielder can use the weapon’s powers.<br/></li><li>The wielder of this weapon is immune to scrying as long as the weapon is being held.<br/></li><li>At the end of an extended rest, the weapon’s bonded wielder gains temporary hit points equal to its healing surge value.<br/></li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Utility Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> By touching one sword of Tyr to another and uttering a command word, a bonded wielder of both weapons can meld them into a single item. When this happens, the bonded wielder chooses the new item’s form (which must be the same as one of the two melding weapons) and which weapon’s magical properties and powers are carried over to the new item. Any daily powers expended on one of the melding weapons are expended on the new weapon. The new item’s enhancement bonus is equal to the greater enhancement bonus of the two melding weapons. The bonded wielder can end this effect and separate the swords as a minor action.</p><h2 class="mihead">Attack Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (No Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Trigger:</i> You hit an enemy with a weapon attack using this weapon.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> The enemy loses an action point.</p><h2 class="mihead"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/Z2a.gif" />Attack Power (Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> You make a melee basic attack with this weapon.
