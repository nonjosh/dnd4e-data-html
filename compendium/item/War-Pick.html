		<h1  class="player">War Pick</h1><br/>Military one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 15 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d8<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 6 lb.<br/><br/>Adapted from the common mining tool, a war pick features a compact design combined with a single, sharp point to punch through armor. Gnomes and halflings favor war picks because of the weapon’s small size.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Versatile (<i>Versatile weapons are one-handed, but you can use them two-handed. If you do, you deal an extra 1 point of damage when you roll damage for the weapon.<br/>A Small character such as a halfling must use a versatile weapon two-handed, and doesn’t deal extra damage.</i>).<br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Pick (<i>Weighted toward the top like a mace or an axe, a pick has a long, pointed head made to pierce and create deep wounds.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 218, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
