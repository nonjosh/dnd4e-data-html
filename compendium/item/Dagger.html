		<h1  class="player">Dagger</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 1 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Light Thrown (<i>A basic attack with a light thrown weapon uses your Dexterity. Light thrown weapons don’t deal as much damage as heavy thrown weapons, but some powers let you hurl several of them at once or in rapid succession.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 218, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247520000" target="_new">Heroes of the Fallen Lands</a>, page(s) 331, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 333.</p>
