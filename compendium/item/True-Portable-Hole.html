It can be enlarged to 6 feet in diameter or shrunk to its smaller size by folding it as one folds a sheet of cloth. When spread upon any surface, a true portable hole transforms into the mouth of an extradimensional space 10 feet deep, into which items can be placed for storage. When the hole is picked up from the surface, the entrance disappears and anything inside the space remains there. The hole cannot be closed if any creatures are within it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The items that can be placed within the portable hole are limited only by volume—up to a maximum of 6 feet by 6 feet by 10 feet—not by weight.<br/></p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 89.</p>
