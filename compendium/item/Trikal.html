You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Axe (<i>Axes are weapons that have bladed, heavy heads and deal vicious cuts. An axeâ€™s weight makes it fine for delivering crushing blows.</i>).<br/>Polearm (<i>Polearms are weapons mounted at the end of long hafts. All polearms also fall into another category of weapon, usually axe, heavy blade, or spear. Polearms are reach weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
