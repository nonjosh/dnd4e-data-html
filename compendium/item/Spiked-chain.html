		<h1  class="player">Spiked chain</h1><br/>Superior two-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 30 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 2d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Weight: 10 lb.<br/><br/>Eladrin duelists are thought to be the first to employ this weapon, and its combination of speed and elegance supports that theory. The spiked chain delivers raking blows from a distance. Like a whip or a flail, it can also wrap around a foeâ€™s legs to send that enemy tumbling to the ground.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Reach (<i>With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Flail (<i>Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 218, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
