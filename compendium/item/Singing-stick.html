		<h1  class="player">Singing stick</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 40 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>The ends of this 2½-foot-long, narrow rod are carved to be slightly wider than the middle. It whistles as it spins in the hands of a proficient user.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Defensive (<i>A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Mace (<i>Much like hammers, maces are blunt weapons that have a heavier head than handle, but they’re more balanced than hammers. They’re useful for delivering crushing blows.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
