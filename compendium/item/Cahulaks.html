		<h1  class="player">Cahulaks</h1><br/>Superior double melee weapon<br/>Cost: 25 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d8<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: 3/6<br/>Weight: 9 lb.<br/><br/>This double weapon features two fourbladed, hafted heads separated by a length of rope. The secondary end is light enough to be used as an off-hand weapon. When one end of this weapon is held by the haft, the rope is long enough to grant the other end reach. The entire weapon can be thrown.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Heavy Thrown (<i>You hurl a thrown weapon from your hand, rather than using it to loose a projectile. A basic attack with a heavy thrown weapon uses your Strength.</i>).<br/>Reach (<i>With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Flail (<i>Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 120.</p>
