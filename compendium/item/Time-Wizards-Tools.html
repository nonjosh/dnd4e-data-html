		<h1 class="miset">Time Wizard's Tools<span class="milevel">Epic Tier</span></h1><p>Spellcasters manipulate the material world and the energy of the planes with ease, but time remains notoriously resistant to magical control. Few wizards and other arcanists specialize in deconstructing time and enchanting objects to manipulate its boundaries, and for good reason. Such characters often suffer the strange effects of this potent magic, disappearing into unseen realms or even coming face to face with themselves for short periods.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item set known as the Time Wizard’s Tools is legendary among arcanists who tinker with time, although the power of its items can be utilized by any character.</p><h3>Time Wizard's Tools Items</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Lvl</th><th class="miset">Name</th><th class="miset">Price (gp)</th><th class="miset">Item Slot</th></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Time-Jumping Boots</td><td>1625000</td><td>Feet</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Crown of Stuttered Time</td><td>2125000</td><td>Head</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Ring of Free Time</td><td>2625000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Staff of Time</td><td>3125000</td><td>Implement</td></tr></table><h3>Time Wizard's Tools Benefits</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Pieces</th><th class="miset">Benefit</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You gain an item bonus to initiative checks equal to twice the number of items you have from this set.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You gain one additional use per day of magic item daily powers.
