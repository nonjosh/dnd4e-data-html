		<h1 class="player">Blessed Soil</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: <br/><b>Price</b>: 10 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 1 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: The soil contained within this small, plain bag has been blessed by a cleric or some other wielder of divine magic. If sprinkled over a casket or grave, blessed soil prevents any corpse buried therein from rising as an undead creature due a ritual. However, blessed soil has no effect on undead creatures that return to life due to other means. A creature might rise as a ghost if compelled to do so by a curse imposed upon it. Many communities require that blessed soil be used as part of any burial ritual. All too often, con artists and unscrupulous ritualists offer fake blessed soil at cheap rates, leaving graveyards rife with potential skeletons and zombies.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 159.</p>
