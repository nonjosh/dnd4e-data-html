		<h1  class="player">Blade of Annihilation</h1><br/>Military one-handed melee weapon<br/><br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d12<br/>Proficient: +2<br/><br/>The origin of the blade of annihilation is not entirely known. Some believe that the powerful tiefling warlock who created the first infernal pact created the blade. Others believe that it is the remains of an ancient curse placed upon Asmodeus, lord of the Nine Hells, for his treachery in slaying the god remembered as He Who Was and rising to rule all devilkind. What is known is that although infernal pact hexblades are hated and loathed by devils, those hexblades bearing a blade of annihilation are met with even greater wrath. This might be due to the fact that some believe the blade is crafted from the essence of slain devils, and that their life force is what powers a hexbladeâ€™s pact.<br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 232.</p>
