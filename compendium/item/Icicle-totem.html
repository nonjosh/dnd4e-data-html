		<h1  class="player">Icicle totem</h1><br/>Superior <br/>Cost: 15 gp<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>An icicle totem is a shaft of unmelting ice, freezing cold to the touch but wrapped with white fur to protect the wielder’s hand.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Empowered Crit (<i>When you score a critical hit with an empowered crit implement, the attack deals 1d10 extra damage. The extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 21st level.</i>).<br/>Energized (cold) (<i>When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement’s damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Totem (<i>A totem is a short length of wood or bone carved to resemble a patron animal or a nature spirit. One end is typically adorned with feathers, teeth, small bones, scraps of hide, leaves, or other symbols of primal power. You can’t make melee attacks with a totem.<br/>If you can wield a totem as an implement, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of implement powers you use through the totem, and you can use its properties and powers. Otherwise, you gain no benefit from wielding a totem.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 195, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
