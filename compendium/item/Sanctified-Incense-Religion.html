		<h1 class="player">Sanctified Incense (Religion)</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Component<br/><b>Price</b>: 1 gp <br/><b>Description</b>: Valuable components must be expended to perform a ritual. Sanctified incense is prepared during certain religious rites and is burned as a powder or a stick.<br/><br/>Components are needed by ritual casters. You purchase as many gold pieces worth of components as you need or can afford. You can use the components associated with a key skill for any ritual that uses that skill. Ritual components are not interchangeable; you can’t use alchemical reagents to perform a ritual requiring sanctified incense, for example. But you can use residuum for any ritual.<br/><br/>You can buy ritual components at some shops, your allies can provide them (sharing the cost of a ritual with you), or you might find them as treasure. However you acquire components, record their value on your character sheet. When you perform a ritual, mark off the ritual’s cost from the appropriate components.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 222.</p>
