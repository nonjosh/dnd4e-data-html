This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or for 5 minutes, whichever comes first. You can move across calm liquid as if it were solid ground. Rough or stormy liquid counts as difficult terrain. When moving across the surface of a liquid, you are in contact with it as you would be in contact with the ground. If the liquid is moving, you move with it as if the ground moved beneath you.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/393" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 393</a>.</p>
