One of the most powerful of his race, he is said to have entered into a pact with the very essence of shadow in order to forge a suitable implement for himself.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with the Shadowstaff, Amarethydd ruled over his people for centuries and exacted tribute from many realms. But in time, the deadly ennui that afflicts the shadar-kai overcame Amarethydd as well, and he faded away after bequeathing his staff to his foremost apprentice. That young individual was soon killed by her rivals, and various shadar-kai wizards and warlocks murdered each other over the staff for many years before a band of human adventurers carried it back to the mortal world—where it has again changed hands several times.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infamous wizard Evard is the last known owner of the Shadowstaff. He seems to have been parted from it under mysterious circumstances, and who or what owns the Shadowstaff now is a matter of speculation. Some believe that the staff abandoned Evard, and that the wizard is looking for the artifact and will deal harshly with anyone who tries to keep it from him. Others say that Evard bargained away the Shadowstaff to a powerful drow prince, who intends to use the device to further his evil designs against the surface world.</p>
