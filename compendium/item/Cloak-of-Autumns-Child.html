While you are gone, all effects on you are suppressed (you don't take ongoing damage, for example). You roll saving throws at the end of each turn as normal, except you gain a +2 power bonus. Also, while gone, you remain as aware of your surroundings as if you were standing in your last position. At the start of each turn thereafter, you can choose to return to any space within 5 squares of your last position. Line of sight between the two positions must exist (you can't reappear on the other side of a wall, for example).</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 150.</p>
