		<h1  class="player">Blowgun</h1><br/>Superior two-handed ranged weapon<br/>Cost: 5 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>This long, tubular weapon is used by blowing on one end. It can launch darts and other agents.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Load Minor (<i>Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Blowgun (<i></i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/373" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 373</a>, page(s) 22, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 19.</p>
