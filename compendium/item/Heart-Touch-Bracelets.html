If that person’s heart beats, you feel it in your bracelet, allowing you to know how fast or slow the person’s heart is beating. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks made against the wearer of the other bracelet, and you are aware if that person is bloodied, stunned, dazed, or unconscious.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wearer of the other bracelet in the pair is aware of the same things in regard to you as long as you wear the heart-touch bracelet.<br/></p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/392" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 392</a>.</p>
