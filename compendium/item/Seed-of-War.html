The soldier occupies its square and can be attacked. It shares your defenses with a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex. It has hit points equal to your  healing surge value. When it takes damage, you can spend a healing surge as a free action to negate that damage.</p><p class="mistat indent">The soldier is treated as one of your allies, can flank enemies, and deals 10 damage to an enemy adjacent to it that is hit by an ally's attack. As a move action, you can cause the soldier to shift 1 square or move 4 squares. When reduced to 0 hit points, or at the end of the encounter, the soldier disappears, and the seed of war reappears in its square.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/241777200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault 2</a>, page(s) 78.</p>
