The weapon’s owner must speak a chosen word when stowing the weapon somewhere on his or her person. This word becomes the weapon’s command word. As a minor action, the weapon’s owner can give the command word and reach for the location where the weapon was last stowed, and it will appear in the owner’s hand. The weapon’s owner can use the same command word or choose a different one each time the weapon is stowed.<br/></p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 29.</p>
