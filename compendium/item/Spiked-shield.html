		<h1  class="player">Spiked shield</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 10 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 7 lb.<br/><br/>This light shield is constructed with a sharpened spike at its center. A spiked shield can be enchanted as a magic shield or a magic weapon, but not both. A spiked shield enchanted as a magic weapon does not occupy a character’s magic item arms slot. Although a character cannot use two shields at the same time, a character wielding a spiked shield enchanted as a weapon can employ arms slot items such as bracers.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
