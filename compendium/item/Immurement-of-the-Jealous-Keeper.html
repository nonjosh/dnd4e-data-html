		<h1 class="mihead">Immurement of the Jealous Keeper<span class="milevel" id="headerlevel">Level 28 Rare</span></h1><p class="miflavor">The shell opens into a brackish-smelling cave filled with algae-slimed coins and sparking stalactites.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Consumable</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85,000 gp</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Consumable (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent">You expend this immurement and change the terrain in a close blast 8 until the end of the encounter. Replace the terrain in the blast with the following terrain and effects:</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>*:</i> The heaps of treasure are difficult terrain, and any creature that enters a square of treasure must make a DC 28 Acrobatics check, or the pile slides the creature 1 square and knocks it prone. Like the rest of the immurement's effects, all the treasure vanishes at the end of the encounter.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>*:</i> The pool is 20 feet deep. Once per encounter, when you start your turn submerged in the pool and bloodied, you regain hit points as if you had spent a healing surge.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>*:</i> At the start of your turn, lightning arcs between the stalactites as shown on the map. Make an attack against each creature in a square crossed by an arc: +31 vs. Reflex; 2d10 + 10 lightning damage. A creature can be attacked in this way only once per turn.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>*:</i> Each heap of treasure is surrounded by a field of grasping draconic claws, as marked on the map. When any enemy enters a square containing claws, the claws make an opportunity attack: Melee touch; +33 vs. AC; 1d12 + 5 damage, and claws grab the target (DC 28 Athletics or Acrobatics to escape). A creature can attack a square of claws (AC 38, other defenses 36, and 50 hit points). Destroying the square also releases a creature grabbed by it.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/383" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 383</a>, page(s) 48.</p>
