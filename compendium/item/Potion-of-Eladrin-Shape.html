		<h1 class="mihead">Potion of Eladrin Shape<span class="milevel" id="headerlevel">Level 2 Common</span></h1><p class="miflavor">A crystal vial contains a milky green liquid that smells simultaneously of hot iron and pine forest. The sharp tang of its flavor leads to the power to take on another form.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Consumable: </b>Potion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 gp</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Consumable (Minor Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent">After consuming this potion, you alter your appearance through illusion, appearing as an eladrin of your gender. Your eladrin guise is not of any particular eladrin, and it shares some of your general features. Thus, if your nose is particularly long or wide for a member of your race, your guise has an eladrin nose of greater size as well. If you have a particularly distinctive feature, such as a facial scar or discolored eye, this too is revealed in your eladrin guise. You retain your attire, mannerisms, voice, and speech patterns. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you dismiss it (a free action). You gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks to pass yourself off as the creature you're imitating, although you do not gain this bonus when speaking.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/393" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 393</a>.</p>
