		<h1 class="player">Flower of the Dawn</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 25 gp <br/><b>Description</b>: Found only near the Maze of Fathaghn, this rare flower emits a fragrance that instantly awakens a sleeping creature, even one in an enchanted slumber, as long as the enchantment was meant to last no longer than a day. The flower must be placed near the sleeperâ€™s nose and pinched (a minor action) to release the fragrance. This act destroys the blossom and awakens the sleeper.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 134.</p>
