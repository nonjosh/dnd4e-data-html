		<h1  class="player">Light mace</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 3 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>The smaller races often prefer this version of the mace because of its lighter weight. It can deliver a solid, if not crushing, blow to an enemy.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Mace (<i>Much like hammers, maces are blunt weapons that have a heavier head than handle, but they’re more balanced than hammers. They’re useful for delivering crushing blows.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
