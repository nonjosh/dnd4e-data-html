While in the flask, the target is removed from play, and it doesn’t age or need to breathe, eat, or drink. When the target is released, it appears in an unoccupied square adjacent to the flask, and the target is dominated by the flask’s bearer until the end of the encounter or until the bearer ends the domination as a minor action. The released target cannot be affected by an iron flask again for a year and a day.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Miss:</i> The power is not expended.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/208" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 208</a>, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/215" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 215</a>.</p>
