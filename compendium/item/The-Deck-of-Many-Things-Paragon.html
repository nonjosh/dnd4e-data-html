		<h1 class="mihead">The Deck of Many Things<span class="milevel">Paragon Level</span></h1><p class="miflavor">This ornate deck of 22 cards is a tool of the forces of chaos and anarchy. It frequently appears when the world has grown too calm, or when someone has grown too powerful, sowing chaos wherever it lands.</p><p class="mistat">The Deck of Many Things is a +5 magic tome implement with the following properties and powers.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Implement:</b> Tome</p><p class="mistat"><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +5d12 damage</p><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>Sorcerers with the Chaos Power class feature can use the Deck of Many Things as an implement for sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers.</li><li>You cannot be dominated.</li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You alter the fortunes of your enemies, forcing an enemy within 10 squares to reroll one attack roll, skill check, or saving throw it made, taking the result you choose.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class="mistat">Roll a d20. Once before the end of the encounter, you can replace any d20 roll made by an ally or an enemy within 5 squares of you with your d20 roll.</p><br/><p class="mitext">The Deck of Many Things is, by itself, an object that holds within it the potential for either great ruin or great reward. Though the true origins of the Deck of Many Things have been lost to the ages, many historians believe that the artifact was originally a gift from a powerful and ancient archfey to a long-forgotten emperor. The archfey knew that the emperor was extremely superstitious and could not resist reading his own fortunes within the cards. Some hold the Deck of Many Things responsible for shattering that ancient empire and giving rise to powerful warlords that vied for control of the remnants of that empire.<bt/>The Deck of Many Things passes from hand to hand, bringing the low the mighty and elevating the meek (and sometimes vice versa).</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Goals of the Deck of Many Things</h2><ul class="mitext"><li>Sow chaos and discord throughout the world.</li><li>Be present at events of great importance, and then add a chaotic element to the proceedings of those events to alter the fortunes of all involved.</li><li>Topple powerful leaders (good or evil) and cause far-spanning organizations to crumble.</li></ul><h2 class="ah1">Roleplaying the Deck of Many Things</h2><p class="mitext">The Deck of Many Things is an agent of chaos that does its work subtly and by working through those who possess it. The Deck wants to use its owner as its agent, making temptation its greatest weapon. Whenever the owner is contemplating a risky action, it might try to tempt its owner by providing signs that it thinks that taking the risk would be a good idea—even if the chances of success are slim.<bt/>The Deck never communicates overtly, but occasionally the top card of the Deck might flip over on its own to reveal whether the Deck is pleased or displeased (this does not trigger the Deck's drawn card effect).<bt/>Additionally, while the owner is holding the Deck, that character occasionally sees visions of multiple possible outcomes of any given action, showing the way luck can affect the outcome.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting Score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is unaligned</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner has the fey origin</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is reduced to 0 hp</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills a solo monster that is higher level (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner obtains a magic item (maximum 1/level)</td><td>-1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner goes a day without casting an arcane spell (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/><h2 class="ah2">Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Hmm, seems like the cards are falling in my favor these days."</i><bt/>When the owner has finally done the Deck's bidding, or enough of it anyways, the Deck gives the owner the chance to draw from it with better-than-average odds of avoiding some of the more ruinous cards.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die, reroll that die until you have a result other than 1.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see "Moving On," below).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Satisfied (12-15)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"There's wisdom in the cards; if only you could see it."</i><bt/>The Deck of Many Things is pleased with the chaos that the owner is sowing, and begins trying to tempt its owner into drawing from it by sweetening the deal with multiple draws.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die (except a d20), reroll that die until you have a result other than 1.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see "Moving On," below).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Normal (5-11)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Curious, the cards show me how big a role luck plays in our lives."</i><bt/>When first drawn from its container, the Deck conveys little more than a sense that so much in the world is a matter of luck, and not skill.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You draw a card from the Deck of Many Things, and then resolve the effect of that card as determined below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see "Moving On," below).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Unsatisfied (1-4)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I'm afraid that it might not be a lucky time for me."</i><bt/>An owner that rejects the Deck's desires soon experiences a streak of bad, if harmless, luck. The luck is mostly an inconvenience for now, but the Deck wants to make sure the owner knows it is displeased.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Any time you roll the maximum result on a die (except a d20), treat the result as a 1 instead.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see "Moving On," below).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Angered (0 or lower)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"The Deck shows me dark portents; my future is looking grim."</i><bt/>An angered Deck of Many Things can be a dangerous item indeed. Anyone drawing from the Deck at this point is extremely likely to find ill luck befalling him or her.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Any time you roll the maximum result on a die, treat the result as a 1 instead.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things, and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck of Many Things then vanishes and is lost (see "Moving On," below).</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Moving On</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"It's gone! Vanished into thin air!"</i><bt/>The Deck of Many Things fades in and out of history, wreaking havoc and upsetting the order of things from time to time. It is an agent of chaos in an otherwise ordered world, and once someone has drawn from the Deck of Many Things it vanishes, never to be seen again by that person. It leaves behind only the fate chosen by the card that was drawn.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">The Cards</h2><p class="mitext">Each card drawn from the Deck of Many Things has a special effect that triggers when it is drawn. Though the concordance score of the artifact determines how many cards are drawn, only one card triggers each draw. The effect of each drawn card is described below.<bt/>Some of the cards are marked as a Ruin. This helps determine which card's effect comes into play when the Deck of Many Things is unsatisfied or angered.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Balance</h2><p class="mitext"><b>Ruin</b></p><p class="mitext">You have been judged—and found wanting. You gain one of the following two minor quests, depending on your alignment. If you are unaligned, you can choose either quest.</p><br/><p class="mitext">If you are good or lawful good:</p><br/><p class="mitext"><b>Minor Quest: A Walk on the Dark Side</b></p><p class="mitext">To be truly a model for good, you must experience evil firsthand. You must slay or otherwise bring ruin to a specific good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of 21st level. Until you complete this quest, you gain no XP rewards from other completed major or minor quests.<bt/><b>Quest XP:</b> 3,200 XP, and if you choose to do so you can change your alignment to unaligned or evil.</p><br/><p class="mitext">If you are evil or chaotic evil:</p><br/><p class="mitext"><b>Minor Quest: A Shot at Redemption</b></p><p class="mitext">None are so vile that they cannot earn redemption if their desire is true. You must pledge yourself to the service of a powerful good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of 21st level, and convince it to grant you spiritual clemency by performing a task it assigns.<bt/><b>Quest XP:</b> 3,200 XP, and if you choose to do so you can change your alignment to unaligned or good.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Comet</h2><p class="mitext">Double the XP award for the next major quest the party completes.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Donjon</h2><p class="mitext"><b>Ruin</b></p><p class="mitext">You are imprisoned by magic—which leaves you in a state of dreamless sleep—deep beneath the earth. Though your body vanishes, your magic items and other gear remain behind you. The party gains the following major quest:</p><br/><p class="mitext"><b>Major Quest: Prison of the Donjon</b></p><p class="mitext">The characters must find the location of your imprisonment.
