		<h1 class="miset">The Returning Beast<span class="milevel">Paragon Tier</span></h1><p>Such a wellspring of life as the Beast of Talgora cannot be quelled forever. The beast possesses such a burning will to live that, despite its having been ”slain,” its spirit yet claws ceaselessly behind death’s door. It persists within the collection of magic items known as the Returning Beast. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each item is composed of a portion of the beast’s body. To make good on its return, it must find and reunite those hidden pieces of its carcass. As its strength grows, it will feed its hunger for vengeance against the Black Call by tracking its members down one by one and destroying them without mercy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item set is a collection of six paragon tier magic items: bands of equilibrium, eye of prophecy, razortail, ring of the deep wood, blade of the stalking predator, and totem of the dancing leaf. These items house the remaining essence of the Beast of Talgora. As pieces are brought together, a primal intelligence becomes apparent to the items’ wielders. If all of the items are reunited, the Beast of Talgora’s spirit will try to force its way back into the world with the help of whoever  possesses the items, whether or not those possessors are willing agents.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beast of Talgora’s spirit cannot control the items that house it or those that wield them, but its powerful presence is always felt. It doesn’t speak, but its intense emotions and broken, violent thoughts bubble constantly through the minds of its wielders. It subtly urges its wielders to push forward, to seek out its remains, and to hunt members of the Black Call. It craves conf lict of every kind and urges characters toward any that comes within reach. It favors brashness and confidence.<br/><br/>Goals of the Returning Beast<br/><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Return to life.<br/><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Exact revenge on the Black Call.<br/><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Destroy anyone and anything in its way.</p><h3>The Returning Beast Items</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Lvl</th><th class="miset">Name</th><th class="miset">Price (gp)</th><th class="miset">Item Slot</th></tr><tr><td>12+</td><td>Razortail</td><td>13000</td><td>Weapon</td></tr><tr><td>14+</td><td>Blade of the Stalking Predator</td><td>21000</td><td>Weapon</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Eye of Prophecy</td><td>25000</td><td>Wondrous Item</td></tr><tr><td>15+</td><td>Totem of the Dancing Leaf</td><td>25000</td><td>Implement</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Bands of Equilibrium</td><td>85000</td><td>Arms</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Ring of the Deep Wood</td><td>85000</td><td>Ring</td></tr></table><h3>The Returning Beast Benefits</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Pieces</th><th class="miset">Benefit</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Each ally who bears a piece of the Returning Beast gains an item bonus to death saving throws equal to the number of allies who bear one or more items from this set.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Each ally who bears an item from this set ignores difficult terrain.</td></tr></table><h1 class="mihead">Razortail<span class="milevel" id="headerlevel">Level 12+ Rare</span></h1><p class="miflavor">This whip is made from vertebrae and razor-sharp spines taken from the legendary Beast of Talgora's tail.</p><table class="magicitem"><tr><td class="mic1">Lvl 12</td><td class="mic2">+3</td><td class="mic3">13,000 gp</td><td class="mic4"> </td><td class="mic1">Lvl 22</td><td class="mic2">+5</td><td class="mic3">325,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td class="mic1">Lvl 17</td><td class="mic2">+4</td><td class="mic3">65,000 gp</td><td class="mic4"> </td><td class="mic1">Lvl 27</td><td class="mic2">+6</td><td class="mic3">1,625,000 gp</td></tr></table><p class="mistat"><b>Weapon: </b>Whip</p><p class="mistat"><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +1d8 damage per plus</p><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>Characters who have a primal class are automatically proficient with this whip.<br/></li><li>You gain a +2 item bonus to the attack rolls of opportunity attacks made with the whip.<br/></li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Trigger:</i> You hit a target with a weapon attack using the whip.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Effect:</i> You grab the target until the end of your next turn.
