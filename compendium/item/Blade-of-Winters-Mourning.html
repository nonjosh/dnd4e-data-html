		<h1  class="player">Blade of Winter's Mourning</h1><br/>Military one-handed melee weapon<br/><br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d10<br/>Proficient: +3<br/><br/>The blade of winter’s mourning is a gift from the fey lords of winter, ice, and snow. It is made from a strange, blue metal that delivers lethal wounds. Because of its supernatural origin, it is lighter and easier to handle than a mundane weapon.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade reflects the elegant fighting style of the rakes and bravos who haunt wintry fey citadels. A rapier of living metal, the blade shifts and moves of its own accord to aid you in battle. It twists to parry attacks, and with its ability to hinder your enemy’s counterattack, you can dart in, deliver an attack, and move away.<br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 226.</p>
