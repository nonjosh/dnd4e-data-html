You can use a move action to cause the weapon to fly up to 6 squares to a square that you can see. The object occupies 1 square, and it cannot flank. Its defenses equal 10 + its level, although it cannot be harmed by any attack. If an attack hits the weapon, it returns to your hand (or it falls in your space if you don’t have a hand free or in the nearest square if it can’t reach you), and this power ends. You can use a minor action to end this power if the weapon is adjacent to you, causing the weapon to return to your hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you can see the weapon, you can make weapon attacks with it while it dances, using its square as the origin square of the attacks (including all attack and damage modifiers that you would normally apply).</p><h2 class="mihead"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/Z2a.gif" />Attack Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> At-Will (Opportunity Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Trigger:</i> An enemy that you can see takes an action that provokes opportunity attacks and is adjacent to the weapon while the weapon’s utility power is in effect.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> You make a melee basic attack against that enemy, using the weapon.</p><h2 class="mihead"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/Z2a.gif" />Attack Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Requirement:</i> The weapon’s utility power must be in effect, and you must be able to see the weapon.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> You make a melee basic attack using the weapon.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 27.</p>
