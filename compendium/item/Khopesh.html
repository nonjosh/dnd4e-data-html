If you do, you deal an extra 1 point of damage when you roll damage for the weapon.<br/>A Small character such as a halfling must use a versatile weapon two-handed, and doesn’t deal extra damage.</i>).<br/>Brutal 1 (<i>A brutal weapon’s minimum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon. When rolling the weapon’s damage, reroll any die that displays a value equal to or lower than the brutal value given for the weapon. Reroll the die until the value shown exceeds the weapon’s brutal value, and then use the new value.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Axe (<i>Axes are weapons that have bladed, heavy heads and deal vicious cuts. An axe’s weight makes it fine for delivering crushing blows.</i>).<br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
