It communicates its goals and satisfaction with its owner through gentle pulls, subtle emotions, and pulses of encouraging or discouraging energy along its haft. The Spear wants to be wielded by a strong, militant ruler, and it prefers commanding and militant owners that take charge and inflict their will on others.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner can fly</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner slays a servant of a god (max 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner conquers a town, city, or kingdom</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner submits to another’s authority (max 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner loses a battle</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/><h2 class="ah2">Transcendent (Over 20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>“None rule over me or my sky.”</i><br/>The Spear is proud to be in the possession of such a great commander.</p><p class="mistat">The Spear’s enhancement bonus increases to +4.<br/><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 thunder damage, or +4d8 thunder damage against creatures standing on the ground.</p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Your fly speed increases by 4.

Hordes yet remain for us to conquer!”</i><br/>The owner has proved himself a champion against the earthbound.

If the owner does not find redemption soon, the Spear exacts punishment upon him or her. Until then, the spear creates predicaments in which the owner might find a path to rulership.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Special:</b> Once per day, when you are addressed by a person of authority, the Spear leaps into its owner’s hands and makes a melee basic attack against the person.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Moving On</h2><p class="mitext"><i>“My sovereignty is in danger!”</i><br/>The Spear of the Skylord leaves its owner in a spectacular fashion. When the owner (typically fashioned “the Skylord”) is engaged in a pivotal battle (often one on a scale involving armies), the Spear leaps from its owner’s hand, and sails into the midst of the enemy or the enemy’s stronghold, where it explodes with thunder and lightning, devastating the enemy. Thereafter, shards of the weapon wander the earth until they are again joined into the Spear.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Spear is displeased with its owner, it instead brings ruin to the owner’s homeland. Massive cyclones and tornadoes descend upon the nation and cause disaster after disaster, and in the chaos the Spear disappears from its owner’s possession.</p>
