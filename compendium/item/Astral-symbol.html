		<h1  class="player">Astral symbol</h1><br/>Superior <br/>Cost: 18 gp<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>An astral symbol is crafted of solidified mist from the Astral Sea and glows with a faint silvery light.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Distant (<i>The range of your area and ranged attack powers increases by 2 when they’re used through a distant implement.</i>).<br/>Energized (radiant) (<i>When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement’s damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Holy Symbol (<i>If you are a member of a class that can use a holy symbol as an implement, you can apply the enhancement bonus of a holy symbol to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any of your powers from that class that have the implement keyword, and you can use a holy symbol’s properties and powers. Members of other classes gain no benefit from wearing or holding a holy symbol.<br/>A holy symbol represents your deity and takes the shape of an aspect of the god. (See pages 21–22 for the symbols of the good, lawful good, and unaligned deities.) As with most other implements, you can’t make melee attacks with a holy symbol.<br/>Unlike other implements, you need only to wear a holy symbol for its property or power to function. If you are wearing or holding more than one holy symbol, none of your symbols function.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 195, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
