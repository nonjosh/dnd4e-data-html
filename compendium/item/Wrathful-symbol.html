		<h1  class="player">Wrathful symbol</h1><br/>Superior <br/>Cost: 23 gp<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>A wrathful symbol is made from black iron mined in Chernoggar and engraved with runes of divine fury.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Empowered Crit (<i>When you score a critical hit with an empowered crit implement, the attack deals 1d10 extra damage. The extra damage increases to 2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 21st level.</i>).<br/>Undeniable (<i>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against Will when attacking with an undeniable implement.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Holy Symbol (<i>If you are a member of a class that can use a holy symbol as an implement, you can apply the enhancement bonus of a holy symbol to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any of your powers from that class that have the implement keyword, and you can use a holy symbol’s properties and powers. Members of other classes gain no benefit from wearing or holding a holy symbol.<br/>A holy symbol represents your deity and takes the shape of an aspect of the god. (See pages 21–22 for the symbols of the good, lawful good, and unaligned deities.) As with most other implements, you can’t make melee attacks with a holy symbol.<br/>Unlike other implements, you need only to wear a holy symbol for its property or power to function. If you are wearing or holding more than one holy symbol, none of your symbols function.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 195, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
