		<h1  class="player">Greenstone orb</h1><br/>Superior <br/>Cost: 27 gp<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>A greenstone orb is carved from a heavy metallic stone that has an affinity for acid magic.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Energized (acid) (<i>When you use an attack power through an energized implement, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls if the power has the keyword that matches the implement’s damage type. The bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and +4 at 21st level.</i>).<br/>Unstoppable (<i>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against Fortitude when attacking with an unstoppable implement.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Orb (<i>If you are a member of a class that can use an orb as an implement, you can apply the enhancement bonus of an orb to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any of your powers from that class that have the implement keyword, and you can use an orb’s properties and powers. Members of other classes gain no benefit from wielding an orb.<br/>An orb is a heavy, round object, usually made of glass or crystal, of a size to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. Orbs range in color, from clear glass to solid ebony, with storms of color erupting deep within their depths. As with most other implements, you can’t make melee attacks with an orb.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 195, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
