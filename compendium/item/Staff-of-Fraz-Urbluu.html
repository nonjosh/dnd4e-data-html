		<h1 class="mihead">Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu<span class="milevel">Heroic to Epic Tier</span></h1><p class="miflavor">This broken staff fragment is clearly part of a larger whole, yet its well-worn sheen hints at guarded power.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Implement:</b> Rod, staff, or wand</p><p class="mistat"><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class="mistat"><b>Critical:</b> +1d8 damage per plus</p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">You gain an item bonus to Arcana, Bluff, and Intimidate checks equal to the item's enhancement bonus.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Lore</h2><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcana DC 23:</b> The Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu was lost during the sack of Hollow's Heart after the demon prince was imprisoned in the natural world. Unable to destroy it, his enemies sundered it into pieces. Even individually, however, the fragments contain their creator's malicious love of deception and potent summoning ability.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arcana DC 31:</b> A great deal of Fraz-Urb'luu's personal power is contained within the staff, but only when it is whole. Reassembling the staff could enable a wielder to usurp control of the 176th layer of the Abyss or potentially destroy the demon prince forever.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Goals of the Staff</h2><ul class="mitext"><li>Be reunited as a complete entity.</li><li>Return to Fraz-Urb'luu to rule over Hollow's Heart.</li><li>Lead unsuspecting mortals down the path of ruin.</li></ul><br/><h2 class="ah1">Roleplaying the Staff</h2><p class="mitext">Each fragment of the staff communicates telepathically with its possessor but frequently attempts to deceive that person. Its preferred method of deception is to claim to be a human soul trapped in the fragment along with the spirits of demons. It encourages the wielder to commit acts of evil while seeking out the other pieces of the staff but, if it is confronted about the evil deeds, it blames the influence of the "demons" inside it while the "human" continues to plead for freedom. If its wielder is willing to aid the staff, it interacts more openly with that individual.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Concordance</h2><p class="mitext">In addition to seeking out and joining other pieces of the staff to itself, each segment of the artifact delights in acts of dishonesty. Regardless of other conditions, the artifact's maximum concordance is determined by the number of pieces that have been gathered and assembled by a single owner.</p><br/><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Each fragment joined to the first</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Owner tricks a good creature into performing an evil act (max 1/day)</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner does not follow up on information about other staff pieces (max 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner admits to the staff's true nature</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><br/><table><tr><th>Number of Pieces</th><th>Maximum Concordance</th></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Two</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Three</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Four</td><td>20</td></tr></table><br/><br/><h2 class="ah2">Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"The staff and I are meant to rule over greater beings, but I will not forsake my companions . . . trust me."</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff might find more comfort from being in the hands of Fraz-Urb'luu, but it is all too eager to trick and destroy demons and mortals while performing as an instrument of its current wielder.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>The item functions as a +4 implement, increasing to +5 if you are 20th level or higher, and to +6 if you are 25th level or higher and the item's concordance is 17 or higher.</li><li>Once per day, you can perform the Summon Demon ritual with no need for components. This item functions as the ritual's focus.</li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Utility Power (Charm) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class="mistat"><b>Effect:</b> Until the end of your next turn, enemies cannot attack you or target you with any effect that targets an enemy. An enemy ignores this effect if you attack it, if it is marked by you, or if it is in your defender aura.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Satisfied (12-15)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I have reached an understanding with this staff now. You need not concern yourself with its motives."</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff is eager to be completed. It spends less time manipulating its wielder and more time seeking to aid the quest to complete the artifact.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>The item functions as a +3 implement, increasing to +4 if you are 16th level or higher.</li><li>The item bonus to skill checks also applies to Diplomacy.</li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Attack Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (No Action)</h2><p class="mistat"><b>Trigger:</b> You hit a target with a charm power using this item.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Effect:</b> You slide the target up to a number of squares equal to the item's enhancement bonus, and the target grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Normal (5-11)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I've told you, this staff is less remarkable than you think, now stop asking about it!"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff periodically lies to the wielder to get its way and encourages the wielder to do the same with others.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">The item functions as a +2 implement, increasing to +3 if you are 6th level or higher.</p><h2 class="mihead">Utility Power (Illusion) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat"><b>Effect:</b> You become invisible until you hit or miss with an attack, or until the end of your next turn.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Unsatisfied (1-4)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I'm not so sure I trust you, or anyone. You tell me one thing, but the staff tells me another."</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtly, the staff tries to convince its wielder to abandon any companions who are unwilling to pursue its agenda. The staff pretends nothing is wrong while it surreptitiously attempts to manipulate events so that it falls into hands that are more willing or compliant. The staff continues to function as if its attitude were normal, but it gains the following property that the DM can use secretly.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">The item uses telepathy 10 to communicate with others and manipulate them into acting against its wielder.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Angered (0 or lower)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"No! I won't lie for you anymore!"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff secretly hampers its wielder and uses its abilities to convince others that its owner is a dangerous liar who must be stopped. The staff continues to behave as if its attitude were unsatisfied, but it gains the following property that the DM must use secretly.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">The item provides no item bonus to any skill checks. Instead, the user takes a -4 penalty to Arcana, Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Moving On</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"It's all been a lie!"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demon of a level equal to the wielder's level + 1d4 appears at a most inopportune time (the middle of a dangerous battle, during a tense negotiation) and attacks the possessor of the staff until it acquires the item or it is destroyed. If the demon is successful, it and the staff return to the Abyss; otherwise another demon appears one week later.</p>
