As a standard action, you can create a portal that links to the preconfigured teleportation circle as if you successfully performed the True Portal ritual (an Arcana check still determines the portal's duration). You can change the permanent teleportation circle to which the staff is linked with a standard action while standing in the new circle.</li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Power (Teleportation) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat">Use this power when you use a close or area power.

The artifact is not shy about voicing its opinions. It is full of wonder for new places that it has not fully explored, and it is full of disdain for locations that it has tarried in too long.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Travel someplace new to staff (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills a fey creature (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner deals peacefully with (or is) a fey creature (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Travel someplace staff has been (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/><h2 class="ah2">Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Even the gods want to see the vistas I've seen!"</i><bt/>The staff loves to travel and talk of where it has been.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">The staff can link to two permanent teleportation portals instead of one.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat">When you hit a fey creature with an attack delivered by Audaviator, you deal 5d6 extra damage.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Satisfied (12–15)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"One of the best things about seeing new places is noticing how the light falls differently."</i><bt/>The staff believes the wielder is on the way to becoming a planar traveler.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">When an enemy slides, pushes, or pulls you, you can choose to move 2 less squares instead of 1.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Normal (5–11)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Don't you yearn to see places where you have never walked?"</i><bt/>Audaviator tries to engage the wielder with stories of interesting places.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Unsatisfied (1–4)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"You're not particularly interesting, are you?"</i><bt/>Audaviator is worried that its wielder would prefer to stay at home rather than travel to far places.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">When an enemy slides, pushes, or pulls you, you move 2 squares more than the attack specifies.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Angered (0 or lower)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"You have no imagination!
