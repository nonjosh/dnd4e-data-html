		<h1  class="player">Dragon paw</h1><br/>Superior double melee weapon<br/>Cost: 40 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d8<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 10 lb.<br/><br/>Short blades attach to either end of this staff. In the center of this double weapon is a guard with a protruding blade perpendicular to the staff. The light, middle blade (which serves as the off-hand end) can be used for quick jabs, ideal for a warrior with a roguish bent.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Defensive (<i>A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.</i>).<br/>Stout (<i>A weapon that has the stout property can be treated as a two-handed weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
