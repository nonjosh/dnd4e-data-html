The shield he carried through his many battles is imbued with the memory of his courage and selflessness. Prator fell during a desperate fight in Minauros, third of the Nine Hells, and his famous shield disappeared for many years, presumably taken as a trophy by some archdevil or pit fiend. About two centuries ago, the Shield of Prator turned up in the clutches of a githyanki pirate defeated by a band of mortal heroes. In the time since, it has been reported in the hands of a different hero or villain every few years.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From tales of its ancient history, the shield is renowned as a formidable defense against the threat of evil. In point of practical application, its powers and properties are equally effective against enemies of any alignment. As with almost all enchanted items, how the Shield of Prator is used depends greatly on the mindset and desires of its current owner.</p>
