		<h1  class="player">Kukri</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 10 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>The blade of this heavy knife curves forward for greater potency. A rogue proficient with the kukri can treat it as a dagger for the purpose of the Scoundrel Weapon Talent class feature.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Brutal 1 (<i>A brutal weapon’s minimum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon. When rolling the weapon’s damage, reroll any die that displays a value equal to or lower than the brutal value given for the weapon. Reroll the die until the value shown exceeds the weapon’s brutal value, and then use the new value.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
