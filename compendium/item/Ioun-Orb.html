You can do so as long as you sustain this power, provided that the orb is never more than 5 squares away from you. If you use the orb to use a daily attack power, or if the orb is ever more than 5 squares away from you, or if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the orb falls in the square it occupies and this power's effect ends.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Sustain Minor:</i> You can move the orb 5 squares and make arcane attacks through it until the end of your next turn.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/371" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 371</a>, page(s) 27.</p>
