		<h1 class="mihead">Book of Infinite Spells<span class="milevel">Paragon Level</span></h1><p class="miflavor">Opening this thick spellbook, bound in strange leather, causes its pages to flip in rapid succession.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Artifact:</b> Implement (tome)<br/><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> +3 to attack rolls and damage rolls<br/><b>Critical:</b> +3d8 damage</p><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>At the end of an extended rest, a character who studied the book for at least an hour of the rest can replace any attack power that he or she knows with a wizard attack power that is the same level or lower and of the same usage (at-will, encounter, or daily). Similarly, the character can replace any utility power with a wizard utility power of the same level or lower. The replacement lasts until the end of the character’s next extended rest.</li><li>When preparing powers from a spellbook at the end of an extended rest, a wizard can use the Book of Infinite Spells to retrain any number of powers in his or her spellbook, choosing from all wizard powers available and following the normal rules for retraining.</i></ul><p class="mistat indent"><b>Special:</b> A character can draw a particular wizard power from the book only once, regardless of which property the character uses.</p><br/><p class="mitext">Legend has it that this tome is the spellbook of the goddess Ioun, dropped from the heavens into the world, and that it is the source of all arcane knowledge. Others say Vecna used the Book of Infinite Spells as his spellbook during his lifetime, and that he knows how any spell cast from it is used. Perhaps both bits of lore are true.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Infinite Spells is a hefty tome that shows signs of its great age. Scars of battle mar its weatherbeaten cover, and the edges of its yellowed pages are blotched with every sort of stain from blood to wine to strange reagents. Yet no wound can ever do great harm to the book, and nothing can obscure the arcane scribbles and runes that describe its spells. Liquids spilled upon the pages bead and slide away from words and diagrams toward the margins. Anything written in the book vanishes unless it pertains to the spells inside. Fire cannot harm it, nor can even the mightiest titan tear out its pages.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume’s original title, if it had one, is long lost to antiquity. The name it is known by today, Book of Infinite Spells, is seemingly not a misnomer: Even a newly created piece of wizardly magic appears instantly in the book, its ink still slightly moist as if the spell had been penned just an hour before. What many—including wizards—don’t know is that the book proves powerful in anyone’s hands, allowing whoever studies it to cast spells.</p>
