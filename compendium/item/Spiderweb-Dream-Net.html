While a creature sleeps, the net is placed over it, and the creature’s dreams are absorbed into the net’s filaments. When the creature awakens, the net can be boiled in a cauldron or other large vessel. The trapped dreams evaporate into steam that rises in wispy shapes, playing out the events of the dream for any to view.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of boiling a net that has captured one creature’s dreams in this manner, the user of the net can cut it into small sections and consume a portion to experience the captured dreams directly, allowing the viewer to experience the same set of dreams over time. A dream experienced in this way is more intense and offers deeper insights about the dreamer. A dream that arises from a portion of a net being  consumed cannot be captured by another dream net. <p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 135.</p>
