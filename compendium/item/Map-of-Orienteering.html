It can display only what you have seen personally, so invisible objects, undiscovered traps or secret doors, and unknown areas around the next corner do not appear on the map. Illusions are faithfully reproduced unless you have previously recognized them as false. Creatures are not shown on the map unless they take the form of objects and have not been recognized for what they are (for example, a gargoyle mistaken for a statue).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map shows the area within 100 feet by default, but you can mentally command it to zoom in or out to display any areas explored within the last 24 hours as a minor action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map automatically erases and begins redrawing after you take an extended rest, unless you command it to do otherwise.<br/></p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 175, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 87.</p>
