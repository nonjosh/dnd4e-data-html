		<h1  class="player">Drow long knife</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 15 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 2 lb.<br/><br/>This blade is three-quarters the length of a longsword, and ends in an outwardly curving hook. Too slender to be considered a short sword and too big for a dagger, it’s known as a long knife.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Heavy Thrown (<i>You hurl a thrown weapon from your hand, rather than using it to loose a projectile. A basic attack with a heavy thrown weapon uses your Strength.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
