		<h1  class="player">Net</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 20 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: 2/5<br/>Weight: 6 lb.<br/><br/>This net consists of a web of rope or cord fitted with heavy  weights. A trailing cord enables the wielder to control entangled opponents.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You canâ€™t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Heavy Thrown (<i>You hurl a thrown weapon from your hand, rather than using it to loose a projectile. A basic attack with a heavy thrown weapon uses your Strength.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Flail (<i>Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/368" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 368</a>, page(s) 64.</p>
