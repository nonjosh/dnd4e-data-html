You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings canâ€™t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Polearm (<i>Polearms are weapons mounted at the end of long hafts. All polearms also fall into another category of weapon, usually axe, heavy blade, or spear. Polearms are reach weapons.</i>).<br/>Spear (<i>Consisting of a stabbing head on the end of a long shaft, a spear is great for lunging attacks.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
