Members of other classes gain no benefit from wearing or holding a holy symbol.<br/>A holy symbol represents your deity and takes the shape of an aspect of the god. (See pages 21–22 for the symbols of the good, lawful good, and unaligned deities.) As with most other implements, you can’t make melee attacks with a holy symbol.<br/>Unlike other implements, you need only to wear a holy symbol for its property or power to function. If you are wearing or holding more than one holy symbol, none of your symbols function.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 195, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
