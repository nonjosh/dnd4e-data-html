As a minor action, a ring wearer can ascertain the following information:<br/>• The current hit points and general status (alive, dying, or dead) of the other ring wearer<br/>• The number of healing surges the other ring wearer has remaining<br/>• Any effects currently affecting the other ring wearer<br/>• The current emotional state of the other ring wearer<br/>• The straight-line distance to the other ring wearer. If the other ring wearer is on a different plane, neither the distance nor the specific plane can be ascertained. <br/>Special: These rings come in pairs. If one ring is disenchanted, the other loses all its magic. The cost covers a set of rings.<br/></p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent">Transfer a single healing surge to the wearer of the other ring. This cannot bring the recipient above his or her total healing surges. If you've reached at least one milestone today, transfer two healing surges.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 158.</p>
