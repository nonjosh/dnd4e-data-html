		<h1 class="player">Doppelganger Mask</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 250 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 1 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: Gnome artists excel at crafting duplicates of creatures’ faces and making them into masks. Not actually magical in construction, a doppelganger mask is so well crafted that it makes its wearer resemble one particular creature, usually as designated by the artist’s patron. One of these masks attaches tightly to the face of any creature that dons it, allowing the wearer to perfectly adopt the features of the creature that the mask depicts. A creature wearing a doppelganger mask gains a +5 bonus to Bluff checks to disguise itself as the kind of creature the mask depicts, as long as the wearer’s body generally resembles that of such a creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A doppelganger mask tears apart when removed from the face, so each can be used only once. Spies and members of the Unseelie underworld often use them, and some masks make their way to criminal organizations in the natural world.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 133.</p>
