		<h1  class="player">Katar</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 3 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>Also known as a punching dagger, this blade has an H-shaped handle that its wielder grasps in his or her fist. By driving this weapon at a foe with a punching motion, the katar’s wielder strikes with deep and deadly attacks.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 218, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
