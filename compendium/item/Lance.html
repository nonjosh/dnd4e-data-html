		<h1  class="player">Lance</h1><br/>Military one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 12 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d10<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 10 lb.<br/><br/>This long, heavy spear relies on the weight and speed of a charging mount to skewer a hapless enemy. Most mounted warriors set aside their lances once they engage in close quarters fighting.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Mounted (<i>A mounted weapon is most effective when you use it while riding a mount. When you use such a weapon while not mounted, you take a -2 penalty to attack rolls with it. While you are mounted, your charge attacks with the weapon deal 1[W] extra damage.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/>Versatile (<i>Versatile weapons are one-handed, but you can use them two-handed. If you do, you deal an extra 1 point of damage when you roll damage for the weapon.<br/>A Small character such as a halfling must use a versatile weapon two-handed, and doesn’t deal extra damage.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Spear (<i>Consisting of a stabbing head on the end of a long shaft, a spear is great for lunging attacks.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
