Until that time, you don't have line of sight or line of effect to any creature, and creatures don't have line of sight or line of effect to you. You also ignore negative ongoing effects, take no damage, and don't need to make saving throws (though you can still do so if you wish). You can take one standard action and two minor actions. At the start of your next turn, you reappear in the space you last occupied or in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice, and you are dazed until the end of your turn.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/241777200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault 2</a>, page(s) 128.</p>
