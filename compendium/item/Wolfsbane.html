		<h1 class="player">Wolfsbane</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 5 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 1/10 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: A flowering plant found both in the natural world and the Feywild, wolfsbane is a key ingredient in a number of potions and alchemical formulas associated with warding off or harming lycanthropes. Wolfsbane is dangerous to handle, because it is poisonous to humanoids in sufficient quantities. A bundle of wolfsbane is usually enough to keep at bay a lycanthrope that lacks serious resolve; lycanthropes find its smell sickening, and though it cannot truly harm them, most go out of their way to avoid it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a poison, wolfsbane has the same effect as ground thassil root (Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide, page 51). Lycanthropes experience a feeling of discomfort when within 30 feet of a bundle of wolfsbane, and any lycanthrope with a Fortitude of 17 or lower cannot willingly enter a square adjacent to a bundle of wolfsbane.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 135.</p>
