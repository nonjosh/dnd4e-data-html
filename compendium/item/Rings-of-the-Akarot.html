		<h1 class="miset">Rings of the Akarot<span class="milevel">Epic Tier Group Set</span></h1><p>In dark barrows and within ancient mausoleums lie the six members of the Akarot. An archaic league of powerful lords, these tyrants once ruled the Six Cities of the Akarot, all long lost to time. The six rulers were said to have wielded potent power—power now locked within the rings that bear their names.</p><h3>Rings of the Akarot Items</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Lvl</th><th class="miset">Name</th><th class="miset">Price (gp)</th><th class="miset">Item Slot</th></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Rom Kala's Tideshield Ring</td><td>225000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Farndak's Glittering Ring</td><td>325000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Ring of Hrumdar's Halls</td><td>425000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Golden Ring of Teros</td><td>525000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Haggaron's Ring of Control</td><td>625000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Kartan's Void Ring</td><td>1125000</td><td>Ring</td></tr></table><h3>Rings of the Akarot Benefits</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Pieces</th><th class="miset">Benefit</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Each ally wearing a ring from this set can communicate telepathically with the others, regardless of distance.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Each ally wearing a ring from this set gains the blood of the Akarot power, described below.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Each ally wearing a ring from this set gains the voice of the Akarot power, described below.</td></tr></table><h1 class="atwillpower"><span class="level"></span>Blood of the Akarot</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You tap into your reserves to restore your vitality and that of your allies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>At-Will</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> Sight</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You spend a healing surge</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One ally wearing a ring from this set</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target regains 10 hit points.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: Using this power does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p><br/>Update (4/12/2010)<br/>In the Target entry, replace “Each” with “One.” In the Effect entry, replace “Each” with “The.”<br/><br/><h1 class="mihead">Rom Kala's Tideshield Ring<span class="milevel" id="headerlevel">Level 21 Uncommon</span></h1><p class="miflavor">The magic of this blue-green ring protects you from the denizens of the sea and lets you stand fast in combat.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Ring Slot</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;225,000 gp</p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">You gain resist 10 to all damage on attacks from aquatic creatures or water creatures.<br/></p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Immediate Interrupt)</h2><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Trigger:</i> You or an ally within 10 squares of you is pulled, pushed, or slid.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Effect:</i> You or your ally ignores the forced movement.</p><p class="mistat indent">If you've reached at least one milestone today, each ally within 10 squares of you reduces the distance of any forced movement by 1 square until the end of the encounter.
