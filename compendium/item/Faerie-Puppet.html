		<h1 class="player">Faerie Puppet</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 2 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 1/2 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: This small fey animate, usually made of wood or cloth, is designed to entertain eladrin children. As with an ordinary puppet, its controller begins moving it by manipulating it with strings. Thereafter, a minor enchantment allows the puppet to continue to move on its own after the puppeteer releases the strings. If the puppet encounters blocking terrain, it randomly turns left or right and continues in the new direction. It does not stop until a creature within 5 squares of it commands it to do so in Elven. <p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 133.</p>
