		<h1  class="player">Double scimitar</h1><br/>Superior double melee weapon<br/>Cost: 40 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 15 lb.<br/><br/>The Valenar elves made this weapon famous. The double scimitar features a curving blade extending out from each side of its handle.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Defensive (<i>A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.</i>).<br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Stout (<i>A weapon that has the stout property can be treated as a two-handed weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
