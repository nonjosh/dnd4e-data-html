		<h1  class="player">Light war pick</h1><br/>Military one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 10 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: -<br/>Weight: 4 lb.<br/><br/>This variation on the pick trades hitting power for speed and agility. Gnomes often favor the light war pick as an off-hand weapon.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>High Crit (<i>A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it. A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Pick (<i>Weighted toward the top like a mace or an axe, a pick has a long, pointed head made to pierce and create deep wounds.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 9, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
