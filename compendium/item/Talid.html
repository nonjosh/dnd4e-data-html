		<h1  class="player">Talid</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 5 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>Made from leather, chitin, and bone, this spiked “gladiator’s gauntlet” augments unarmed attacks. A talid can be enchanted as either a hands slot item or as a magic weapon. When enchanted as a magic weapon, it does not occupy a character’s hands slot.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Unarmed (<i>When you punch, kick, elbow, knee, or even head butt an opponent, you’re making an unarmed strike. A simple unarmed attack is treated as an improvised weapon. Creatures that have natural weapons such as claws or bite attacks are proficient with those natural weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
