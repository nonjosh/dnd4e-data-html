		<h1 class="player">Raven's Feather</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: <br/><b>Price</b>: 25 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 1/10 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: This plain black feather ends in a small iron needle. When the item’s user pricks a creature’s skin with the needle, just enough to draw blood, the feather forms a mystic bond to that creature. At the moment of that creature’s death, the black feather turns bloodred. Merchants and travelers leave raven’s feathers with their loved ones, while some thieves’ guilds and mercenary bands require initiates to leave one with their superiors. One of these feathers is by no means infallible. There is no way to inspect the feather to ensure that it is linked to a specific person. It is easy enough to fake one’s death by passing off a feather attuned to a different creature as belonging to someone else.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 159.</p>
