A critical hit deals maximum weapon damage and an extra 1[W] at 1st–10th levels, an extra 2[W] at 11th–20th levels, and an extra 3[W] at 21st–30th levels. This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.</i>).<br/>Versatile (<i>Versatile weapons are one-handed, but you can use them two-handed. If you do, you deal an extra 1 point of damage when you roll damage for the weapon.<br/>A Small character such as a halfling must use a versatile weapon two-handed, and doesn’t deal extra damage.</i>).<br/>Small (<i>This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can’t normally use two-handed weapons.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Heavy blade (<i>Blades are balanced edged weapons. Heavy blades share some of the precision of light blades and some of the mass of axes. Heavy blades are used primarily for slashing cuts rather than stabs and thrusts.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
