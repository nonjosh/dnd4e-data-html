It issues demands to its owner, and screams with rage when it is not obeyed. The more the user obeys the seed, the more he or she becomes aloof, cold, and authoritarian, willing to resort to harsh means to accomplish any task. Some say that the Seed of Winter contains the resonance of an archfey who once lived in the Winter Court.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting Score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a creature with the cold keyword</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner has at least one power with the cold keyword</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills a creature with the fire keyword (1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner dominates or intimidates a creature (1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner refuses the Seed (2/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner or an ally kills a creature with the cold keyword (1/day)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner frees a creature from mental control (1/day)</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><br/><h2 class="ah2">Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"The Seed and I shall bring forth the icy grip of obedience to those who try to deny us."</i><bt/>Harsh, dominating, and cold, the wielder and the Seed are one with each other.</p><br/><p class="mistat">The Seed's enhancement bonus increases to +4.</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 cold damage, or +4d10 cold damage against creatures with the fire keyword</p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">You gain resist 10 cold.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power (Charm) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Minor Action)</h2><p class="mistat">An enemy within 5 squares of you makes a melee basic attack against an adjacent target of your choice.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Satisfied (12–15)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"The Seed and I prepare the weak for the bitter times ahead."</i><bt/>The wielder has proven worthy to possess the Seed, which grows more sated with each cold victory.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">You gain resist 5 cold.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (Free Action)</h2><p class="mistat">You can use this power when you hit an enemy with a power that slows the target.
