		<h1 class="player">Screaming Scarecrow</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 50 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 15 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: Although hags originally created scarecrows, gnomes stole the idea and adapted it to their purposes. When a creature within 4 squares of a screaming scarecrow triggers a condition that was set when the scarecrow is placed (such as “a creature passes through the area without saying a password,” or “a human enters the area”), the scarecrow begins to scream. When this happens, any other screaming scarecrow within 50 feet of it also begins to scream.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a creature attempts to use Stealth to bypass a screaming scarecrow, the scarecrow uses the passive Perception of the creature that placed it, with a +10 bonus. Many fey use screaming scarecrows as an efficient alarm system.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 135.</p>
