		<h1  class="player">Widow's knife</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 1 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Range: 5/10<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>Although this weapon originated as a harvesting tool, it has become a favorite in noble courts. The blade is a flat semicircle. The grip can be modified to hold poison. A widow’s knife and a dagger are similar weapons.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/>Light Thrown (<i>A basic attack with a light thrown weapon uses your Dexterity. Light thrown weapons don’t deal as much damage as heavy thrown weapons, but some powers let you hurl several of them at once or in rapid succession.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
