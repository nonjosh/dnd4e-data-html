Many dwarves believe that Moradin crafted the Hammer as his original weapon of choice. Yet the legends of most other races attribute the artifact to the ambition of Kord, who gained his power over storms by slaying a primordial of tempests. According to such stories, the Hammer is the primordial’s heart, ripped free from its body and twisted into its present shape by Kord’s bare hands.</p><p class="mitext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Moradin or Kord did create the Hammer of Thunderbolts, neither seems to miss it. Instead, the weapon has cascaded through history from the possession of one great hero or villain to the next. Though it is certainly a weapon of nearly inestimable value in melee, the true power of the hammer manifests only when it is hurled at foes. Then the roar of the storm echoes about it, and some of these throws culminate in a radiating wave of thunder that flattens every creature nearby.</p>
