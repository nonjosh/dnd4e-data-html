		<h1 class="player">False Path Stones, 1 bag</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 200 gp <br/><b>Weight</b>: 2 lb<br/><b>Description</b>: Devious creatures that want to bait unwitting mortals into entering the Feywild for the first time use these tiny, charmed stones to cruel effect. When a creature takes a few stones from the bag and places them on the ground, a small gravel path springs up that looks like a well-traveled route leading in whatever direction the creature chooses. Once a route has been started, the stones in a bag can be used only for that route, and the rest of them must be laid continually. The path can be up to 5 miles long, provided the creature blazing the trail walks the entire distance, dropping the rest of the stones from time to time along the way. The path lasts for a day before it disappears; the area it described returns to the state it was in before the stones were used, and the stones become like any other ordinary rocks scattered in the wilderness.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scouts in the wild use false path stones to create simple roads that make travel easier for those following behind them.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 133.</p>
