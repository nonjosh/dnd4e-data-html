If you win the opposed check, the creature treats you as a trusted friend until the end of the encounter. The creature is not dominated and does not automatically follow your orders. However, it reacts to your suggestions in the most favorable way. The creature is not aware that you used this power against it. If you or your allies attack a creature under the effect of this power, the effect ends on that creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature engaged in combat with you or your allies gains a +10 bonus to its Insight check.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Milestone:</i> If youâ€™ve reached at least one milestone today, the effect lasts until the end of your next extended rest.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 77.</p>
