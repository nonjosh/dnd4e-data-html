By day, the plantâ€™s flowers resemble those of any other vegetation. In the twilight just after sunset, its flowers glow slightly. At midnight, gazing down on a field of star-indigo plants is like looking at the night sky in reverse, as its flowers shine  as brightly as the stars. Feywild creatures often arrange star-indigo seeds in symbols and messages that can be seen only in the dark of night. Dyes made from star-indigo plants pass their nocturnal glowing quality to clothing and ink, and an object colored with these dyes emits light equivalent to  that of a candle. <p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 135.</p>
