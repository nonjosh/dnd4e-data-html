One end is typically adorned with feathers, teeth, small bones, scraps of hide, leaves, or other symbols of primal power. You can’t make melee attacks with a totem.<br/>If you can wield a totem as an implement, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of implement powers you use through the totem, and you can use its properties and powers.
