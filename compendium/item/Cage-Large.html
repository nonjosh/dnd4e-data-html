		<h1 class="player">Cage (Large)</h1><br/><b>Category</b>: Gear<br/><b>Price</b>: 80 gp <br/><b>Description</b>: Cages are made of strong material to confine creatures. A cage has equally spaced bars and a door. Bar spacing can be customized to specific creatures. The typical cage can hold two creatures of its size, a creature one size larger (uncomfortably), or four to six creatures one size smaller. (Creatures more than one size smaller than the cage probably will be able to slip out between the bars.) Cages are normally transported on animals or vehicles. A vehicle such as a wagon can have a cage permanently mounted to it by adding the cage cost to the vehicle cost.<br/><br/>—Number of Creatures Held—<br/><table><tr><th>Huge</th><th>Large</th><th>Medium</th><th>Small</th><th>Break DC</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>20</td></tr></table><br/>*A cage can be made stronger by doubling the cost for each +5 to the break DC.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/391" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 391</a>.</p>
