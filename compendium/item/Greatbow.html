		<h1  class="player">Greatbow</h1><br/>Superior two-handed ranged weapon<br/>Cost: 30 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d12<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Range: 25/50<br/>Weight: 5 lb.<br/><br/>This massive, recurved bow stands as tall as a human when strung, and it fires arrows with greater power than a traditional longbow.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Load Free (<i>Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows “load free” on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is “load minor,” which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Bow (<i>A bow is a shaft of strong, supple material with a string stretched between its two ends. It’s a projectile weapon that you use to fire arrows. Bows take training to use effectively, and they can be extremely deadly in expert hands.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 10.</p>
