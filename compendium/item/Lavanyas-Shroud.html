That ally is restored to maximum hit points. The radiant spirit of Lavanya appears briefly in  the ally’s square, creating a zone of bright light in a burst 10 centered on the ally that lasts until the end of the encounter. The zone moves with the ally. While in the zone, you and each ally gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws. Undead enemies gain vulnerable 10 radiant while in the zone. If the undead enemy is already vulnerable to radiant damage, increase its vulnerability by 10.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Level 30:</i> +4 item bonus to saving throws; vulnerable 15 radiant or increase vulnerability by 15.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/402" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 402</a>.</p>
