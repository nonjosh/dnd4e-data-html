		<h1 class="miset">Xenda-Dran’s Array<span class="milevel"> Tier</span></h1><p>Slaads are known for their imposing presence and their unpredictability, yet the legendary Xenda-Dran struck fear into even the mightiest of his kindred. Sages say that during Dran’s metamorphosis into what should have been a green slaad, he instead became something else, a creature that drew power from both chaos and shadow. This new Dran was quickly recruited to the service of the slaad Ygorl, Lord of Entropy, as a sorcerous assassin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few killers have shed more blood across the worlds than Xenda-Dran. The slaad took great pleasure in assassinating powerful enemies, and with each slaying his powers grew stronger. The mightiest denizens of the Elemental Chaos found their existences cut short as they were strangled by their own shadows or saw their own flesh stripped from their bones by discordant energies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xenda-Dran began to collect trophies from his greatest kills, and he enchanted them into armaments that made him even more formidable. <br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the hands of a rival assassin, the babau Timmevinc, the slaad crafted grisly gauntlets that channeled the demon’s corrosive power.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dran defeated a pack of ice devils bent on Ygorl’s death in the middle of a deadly storm, he claimed the leader’s horn for a special focus.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hides of sixty-six different elemental denizens were sewn into his cloak, including the skins of slaad warriors, the scales of demons, and the preserved flesh of myriad archons.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The djinn lord Abisali-agharr sat in his fortified palace in the clouds, surrounded by mighty elemental warriors. Still, he could not find safety from Xenda-Dran’s blades, and his soul was trapped in the assassin’s magic ring.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most powerful slaads who crossed Dran met grisly fates—Dran’s boots were made from the remains of the void-bending black and gray slaads, reminding his fellows that he found them fit only for treading on.<br/><br/>The legends are unclear on how Xenda-Dran met his end. Some say his final adversary was none other than the enlightened githzerai master, Liricosa. Most believe that Dran was destroyed in their confrontation, but some monks claim that Liricosa’s transcendent wisdom taught even a slaad the way of order. They believe that Xenda-Dran transformed one final time, into one of Liricosa’s pupils.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever truly happened, Xenda-Dran’s armaments were scattered throughout the worlds. From time to time, the items resurface, spreading death and destruction before disappearing again, inspiring legends as well as the crafting of many imitations.</p><h3>Xenda-Dran’s Array Items</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Lvl</th><th class="miset">Name</th><th class="miset">Price (gp)</th><th class="miset">Item Slot</th></tr><tr><td>10+</td><td>Babau Gauntlets</td><td>5000</td><td>Hands</td></tr><tr><td>11+</td><td>Ring of the Djinn Slayer</td><td>9000</td><td>Ring</td></tr><tr><td>8+</td><td>Hailstorm Ki Focus</td><td>3400</td><td>Implement</td></tr><tr><td>8+</td><td>Rift Dancer Boots</td><td>3400</td><td>Feet</td></tr><tr><td>9+</td><td>Elemental Ward Cloak</td><td>4200</td><td>Neck</td></tr></table><h3>Xenda-Dran’s Array Benefits</h3><table class="ignore"><tr><th class="miset">Pieces</th><th class="miset">Benefit</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>At the end of each extended rest, choose acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning.
