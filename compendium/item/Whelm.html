		<h1 class="mihead">Whelm<span class="milevel">Paragon Level</span></h1><p class="miflavor">An anathema to goblins, trolls, and giants, Whelm is a war hammer of noble bearing originally crafted by dwarves. Its spirit is a born hunter, driving its wielder to slay the weapon's enemies.</p><p class="mistat">Whelm is a +3 magic warhammer with the following properties and powers.</p><p class="mistat"><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +3d6 damage, or +3d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size.</p><h2 class="mihead">Properties</h2><ul class="mistat"><li>Gain a +2 item bonus to Perception checks.</li><li>You can make a ranged basic attack with Whelm as if it has the heavy thrown property and a range of 5/10.</li></ul><h2 class="mihead">Power (Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> At-Will (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">As the paladin's valiant strike power (PH 92).</p><h2 class="mihead">Power (Thunder, Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Encounter (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">As the paladin's thunder smite power (PH 94).</p><h2 class="mihead">Power (Healing, Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">As the paladin's bloodied retribution power (PH 95).</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Goals of Whelm</h2><ul class="mitext"><li>Hunt and slay goblins, trolls, and giants.</li></ul><h2 class="ah1">Roleplaying Whelm</h2><p class="mitext">Whelm communicates empathically with its wielder, expressing a constant desire to hunt. The weapon is terse in expressing its wishes. When the wielder has gone a long time without hunting and ignores Whelm's appeals, the weapon might take over, seeking another to take it hunting or flying from the wielder's hand when he or she least expects it. Whelm is desperately unhappy serving the joyless Ctenmiir, who, because of his curse, never goes hunting.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a dwarf</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills a goblin, troll, or giant (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner fails to kill a goblin, troll, or giant within 1 week</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a goblin, troll, or giant</td><td>-5</td></tr></table><br/><h2 class="ah2">Pleased (16-20)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Through my efforts, a new dawn is rising, bringing a day without goblins, trolls, and giants."</i><bt/>Whelm and the wielder fight in unity against their foes. Each understands the other's desires, and they are of one mind. They have begun a personal war against goblins, trolls, and giants.</p><br/><p class="mistat">Whelm becomes a +4 magic warhammer.</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 damage, or +4d10 against creatures larger than Medium size.</p><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Gain a +2 item bonus to initiative checks</p><h2 class="mihead">Power (Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">As the fighter's dragon's fangs power (PH 82).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Satisfied (12–15)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I am the hunter, and they are my prey."</i><bt/>Whelm is content with its wielder but still believes that a better hunter is out there. The weapon accepts the wielder, continuing to express a desire to hunt while also searching for an owner more devoted to its cause.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">Whelm's bonus to Perception checks becomes +3.</p><h2 class="mihead">Power <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat">As the paladin's turn the tide power (PH 95).</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Normal (5–11)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I sense that I have a great fate with this weapon."</i><bt/>When Whelm first comes in contact with the wielder, it expresses a hatred of giants, trolls, and goblins. If the hammer senses that it is well received, Whelm encourages the wielder to take steps to accomplish its goal. Otherwise, the weapon looks for a new wielder.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Unsatisfied (1–4)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Whelm's purpose is too narrow, and I have a greater destiny."</i><bt/>Whelm believes its wielder has little chance of achieving its goals. It actively searches for another wielder and even undermines its owner's activities.</p><br/><h2 class="mihead">Property</h2><p class="mistat">You take a -2 penalty to initiative checks.</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Special:</b> You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls against targets that are not goblins, trolls, or giants. This applies whether you are using or even holding Whelm.</p><br/><h2 class="ah2">Angered (Below 1)</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"I can no longer abide Whelm's selfish pursuits."</i><bt/>Whelm is fed up with its wielder and seeks any reasonably suited creature to own it. The weapon defies its wielder, thrusting him or her into situations with little hope of success.</p><br/><p class="mistat">Whelm becomes a +2 magic warhammer.</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Critical:</b> +2d6 damage, or +2d10 against creatures larger than Medium size.</p><p class="mistat indent"><b>Special:</b> You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls against creatures that aren't goblins, trolls, or giants. This applies whether you are using or even holding Whelm.</p><br/><h2 class="ah1">Moving On</h2><p class="mitext"><i>"Whelm believes its destiny lies elsewhere, so I surrender the weapon to fate."</i><bt/>Whelm knows it can accomplish nothing more with its current wielder. When the character next gains a level, the weapons disappears. If the weapon is at least satisfied, it leaves behind a +3 magic warhammer.</p>
