		<h1  class="player">Wrist razors</h1><br/>Simple one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 1 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d4<br/>Proficient: +3<br/>Weight: 1 lb.<br/><br/>This weapon consists of three sharp blades that protrude from a sturdy bracer, freeing the wielder’s hand. A shield cannot be worn on the same arm as wrist razors. Wrist razors do not need to be drawn, nor do they need to be sheathed for the wielder to use the hand the razors are on. An enchanted wrist razor occupies the arms slot.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
