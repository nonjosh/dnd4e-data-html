When this happens, the bonded wielder chooses the new item’s form (which must be the same as one of the two melding weapons) and which weapon’s magical properties and powers are carried over to the new item. Any daily powers expended on one of the melding weapons are expended on the new weapon. The new item’s enhancement bonus is equal to the greater enhancement bonus of the two melding weapons. The bonded wielder can end this effect and separate the swords as a minor action.</p><h2 class="mihead"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/Z2a.gif" />Attack Power (Weapon) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> Daily (Standard Action)</h2><p class="mistat indent"><i>Effect:</i> You make a melee basic attack with this weapon.
