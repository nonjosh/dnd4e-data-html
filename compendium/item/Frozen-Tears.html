These icicles, known themselves as frozen tears, are said to be sorrow made manifest. Even when they carried away from the prince’s demesne in the Vale of the Long Night, frozen tears do not melt, instead chilling any object or creature in contact with them. Although they aren’t cold enough to cause damage, frozen tears are fervently sought by Feywild merchants, who use them to keep perishable goods chilled during transport—a handy trick for bringing specialized food and drink to the courts to satisfy the refined appetites of the archfey. <p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 134.</p>
