Until the end of your next turn, you gain the ability to see as if you were standing in a square at any location within 2 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to the location, but it must be a place already known to you or clearly defined (for example, a square on the other side of a door that you can see). Your perception of the area is with your normal senses, and you might need to make Perception checks to note specific features of the area.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Level 15:</i> Any location within 5 squares of you.</p><p class="mistat indent1"><i>Level 25:</i> Any location within 10 squares of you.</p><p class="mistat indent"><i>Sustain Minor:</i> You sustain the effect until the end of your next turn, and you can shift the point of view of your clairvoyance to another square within 2 (or 5 or 10) squares of you.</p><br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/28069000" target="_new">Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium</a>, page(s) 91.</p>
