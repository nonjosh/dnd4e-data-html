		<h1  class="player">Tortoise blade</h1><br/>Superior one-handed melee weapon<br/>Cost: 10 gp<br/><b>Damage</b>: 1d6<br/>Proficient: +2<br/>Weight: 7 lb.<br/><br/>This bony or chitinous plate is affixed with a short blade that points forward from the wielder’s hand. An enchanted tortoise blade can be used as a magic shield or a magic weapon, but not both. When enchanted as a magic weapon, it does not occupy a character’s arms slot. A tortoise blade and a spiked shield are considered to be the same weapon.<br/><br/><b>Properties</b>: <br/>Off-Hand (<i>An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can’t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.</i>).<br/><br/><b>Group</b>: <br/>Light blade (<i>Light blades reward accuracy as much as force. Pinpoint attacks, lunges, and agile defenses are the strong points of these weapons.</i>).<br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 121.</p>
