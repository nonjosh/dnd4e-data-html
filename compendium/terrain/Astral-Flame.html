		<h1 class="dm">Astral Flame</h1><p class="flavor">Astral flame is the burning essence of the Astral Sea. It is a fountain of fiery liquid that sheds bright light in a 20-square radius.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>It costs 1 extra square of movement to enter a square of astral flame. A creature that enters an astral flame square or starts its turn there takes 10 radiant damage per tier. A creature adjacent to an astral flame square can coat a weapon or implement in the astral flame as a minor action. Until the end of the encounter, attacks using that weapon or implement gain the radiant keyword.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Large areas of astral flames will work well with creatures that have resistance or immunity to radiant damage, allowing them to ignore the flameâ€™s radiant damage while the characters must decide if entering into the astral flame square is worth the damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrain is also a good way to give creative characters a boost against creatures that are vulnerable to radiant damage. Use minions to guard a single astral flame square while an elite or solo leader that is vulnerable to radiant damage attacks the group in another part of the encounter area.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
