		<h1 class="dm">Choking Vapors</h1><p class="flavor">These fumes rise from volcanic vents, venomous incense—or both, in the case of rare sacrifices involving yuan-ti priests that expect to rise again after dying within the vent where the sacrifice is conducted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>These squares are lightly obscured, and creatures in them must hold their breath or suffocate. (See “Suffocation".) Creatures that have immunity or resistance to poison are immune to this effect.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Add complexity to an encounter by introducing the vapors after a fight starts. Or have a creature that has poison resistance use the vapors to hide in while it attacks from concealment.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251260000" target="_new">The Plane Above</a>, page(s) 86.</p>
