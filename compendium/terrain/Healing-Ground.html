		<h1 class="dm">Healing Ground</h1><p class="flavor">This area is infused with primal energy that allows life of all sorts to flourish. Undergrowth or fungus that thrives on the primal energy in the place grows wildly and chokes the area with its profusion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>If a creature in this terrain spends a healing surge, it regains an additional 2 hit points per tier. Healing ground is also difficult terrain due to the abundant plant life.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Healing ground, assuming that the characters can recognize it, is a good example of attractive terrain that gives characters an incentive to move into a room and take up advantageous positions.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 60.</p>
