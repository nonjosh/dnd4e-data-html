		<h1 class="dm">Elemental Spout</h1><p class="flavor">Eruptions of material or elemental energy are a common occurrence in the Plane Below. Any substance can issue forth from solid surfaces, bodies of liquid, raging storms, or empty air.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>An elemental spout fills a burst, 1 square per tier, centered on a particular origin square. The spout might erupt at intervals or when a creature moves within 1 square of the burst’s center. For interval eruptions, the spout rolls initiative at the start of combat or takes effect at a specific time in a round; for an erratic spout, you might roll initiative each round.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of an elemental spout depends on the type of energy or material it disgorges. A summary of common elemental spouts and their effects follows. Exotic spouts also exist that contain more than one substance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acid: 5 acid damage per tier, and ongoing 5 acid damage per tier (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost: 5 cold damage per tier, and the target is slowed (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning: 5 lightning damage per tier, and the target is dazed (save ends). If a target is already dazed, it is instead stunned (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magma: 5 fire damage per tier, and ongoing 5 fire damage per tier (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison Gas: 5 poison damage per tier, and the target is weakened (save ends).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scalding Slick: 5 fire damage per tier, and the target is knocked prone.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder: 5 thunder damage per tier, and the target is pushed 2 squares from the spout’s origin square.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Elemental spouts break up an encounter area and give the characters a reason to move in certain ways, whether to avoid the effects of the spouts or to use them in a clever tactical way. Creatures that have resistance or are immune to a spout’s effects can take advantage of the spout to block and damage enemies.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 14.</p>
