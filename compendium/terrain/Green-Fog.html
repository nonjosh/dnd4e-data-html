		<h1 class="dm">Green Fog</h1><p class="flavor">A swirling green mist spreads across the ground, moving despite the lack of a breeze. As strange as the mists are, their sinister nature is not revealed until a creature vanishes into the fog. The mist transforms and corrupts the unwary soul, twisting it into a horrid mockery of what it once was. Unless the creature can somehow shake the green fog’s effects quickly, the transformation will become permanent.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A patch of green fog covers an area 4 squares on a side. Squares in the fog are lightly obscured. Each round on initiative count 10, roll a d4. The green fog moves a number of squares equal to the die result in a random direction. Should the green fog move entirely out of the encounter area, remove the fog from play.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any living creature that starts its turn in the green fog must make a saving throw. On a save, there is no effect. On a failed saving throw, the creature becomes a green fog mutant (save ends). Until the effect ends, the creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls, speed, and skill checks, but gains a +2 bonus per tier to damage rolls.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a creature ends the encounter still subjected to the green fog’s effects, the effects are permanent until the creature is the recipient of a Remove Affliction ritual or similar magic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Green fog is not natural to the world; it originated in the Far Realm. For this reason, the queer mist only appears in tortured landscapes and warped terrain where the Far Realm’s influence has been felt.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/34416000" target="_new">The Book of Vile Darkness</a>, page(s) 2-28.</p>
