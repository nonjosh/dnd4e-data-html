		<h1 class="dm">Angelic Lantern</h1><p class="flavor">Angelic lanterns are faint manifestations of divine will. These tiny, pulsating balls of light float in a square, shedding bright light in a 20-square radius.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A creature in a square containing an angelic lantern gains a +1 bonus per tier to attack rolls with divine or radiant attack powers. Once an angelic lantern grants this bonus to a creature, it winks out of existence at the end of the turn in which it granted the bonus.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Since angelic lanterns are one-shot terrain effects, it’s more interesting to include a number of them in an encounter. Use the lanterns in an encounter with skirmishers that have radiant attack powers to create a moving battlefield where the monsters are seeking out each lantern’s bonus. Once the characters understand the benefit the lanterns provide, it will be a race for the characters to reach the lantern squares, either to take advantage of their effect, or to block their opponents from doing so.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
