		<h1 class="dm">Erratic Portal</h1><p class="flavor">When the magic of a portal begins to fail, it might transform into an erratic portal.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a creature ends its movement in an erratic portal square, it must make a saving throw. If the creature saves, it can teleport up to 5 squares per tier as a free action. If it fails, the creature can teleport up to 2 squares per tier as a free action, and it takes 10 lightning damage per tier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>As with all terrain that teleports or moves creatures, use erratic portals to create a complex encounter that allows the combatants to rapidly move around the battlefield. This will make life difficult for defenders, but also rewards those who can make an attack against a marked opponent that shifts away. Include elite or solo monsters (and their better saving throws) to make it a challenging encounter.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
