This movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you can let go from the vine at any point during this movement. If you reach the ending square, you can make an Athletics check to jump at the end of the swing, treating it as a jump with a running start, but you must jump in the same direction as the movement of the swinging vine or rope.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Failure:</b> You do not move, and your move action ends.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect:</b> When placing a swinging vine or rope in an encounter, the DM must determine the rope’s starting square, its path of travel, its ending square, and whether it can travel in both directions.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 63.</p>
