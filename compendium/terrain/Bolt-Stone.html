		<h1 class="dm">Bolt Stone</h1><p class="flavor">In some areas, lightning energy fuses with rock to form a highly unstable, dangerous mixture. In various regions of the Elemental Chaos, and in dungeons located near the conflux of different types of elemental energy, blue-tinged areas of bolt stone appear.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a creature enters a square of bolt stone, it takes 5 lightning damage per tier. Roll a d20; on a 10 or higher, the bolt stoneâ€™s energy is discharged, and the stone becomes inert. Otherwise, the lightning energy is transferred to all unoccupied squares adjacent to the origin square, and those squares become bolt stone.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Bolt stone works best when you scatter it across an encounter area. It offers some risk and reward. A player character might enter a square and take the damage in the hope of creating a barrier to hold back monsters or eliminate minions.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 58, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/244640000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Kit</a>, page(s) 209.</p>
