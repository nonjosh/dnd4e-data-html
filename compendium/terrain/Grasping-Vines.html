		<h1 class="dm">Grasping Vines</h1><p class="flavor">Vines, roots, and other vegetation that has become infused with aberrant energies emanating from agathys can entangle those that come near.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a creature starts its turn in or adjacent to a square of grasping vines, it must make a saving throw. If the creature saves, it’s slowed until the start of its next turn; otherwise, it’s restrained until the start of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Creatures familiar with the local landscape might use grasping vines as part of a trap for unwary visitors, focusing their attention subsequently on the ones who remain unrestrained.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251260000" target="_new">The Plane Above</a>, page(s) 107.</p>
