		<h1 class="dm">Jade Flame</h1><p class="flavor">This strange, vibrant green fire burns everything that comes near it, yet the nature of its magic is such that a creature it burns cannot be harmed by other sources of heat for a limited time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A creature that enters a square of jade flame or that starts its turn adjacent to such a square takes ongoing 5 radiant damage per tier (save ends). However, until the creature saves against the ongoing damage, it has resist fire equal to 10 per tier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Jade flame offers the characters a choice. They can accept some constant radiant damage in return for protection against a potentially more dangerous threat. The characters might need to use jade flame to protect themselves before they race across a lava chamber or face another sort of fire hazard.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 60.</p>
