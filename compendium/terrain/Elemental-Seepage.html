		<h1 class="dm">Elemental Seepage</h1><p class="flavor">Elemental seepage is elemental fire, cold, thunder, or lightning, or some combination of the four. The seepage takes the form of a strange, viscous mass that pulsates and quivers with the energy of the Elemental Chaos. In general, elemental seepages are harmless, though some contain one-way, imprecise portals to the Elemental Chaos.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>An elemental seepage appears as an area of at least 4 contiguous squares. A creature within 5 squares of an elemental seepage square that uses an attack power with a keyword corresponding to any of the energy types forming the seepage gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls per tier with that power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Use this terrain to give creatures with attacks that match the seepage damage type extra hitting power. If you include only a few elite creatures whose attacks match the terrainâ€™s damage type, it creates an interesting tactical situation where the characters are trying to keep those creatures more than 5 squares from the seepage.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
