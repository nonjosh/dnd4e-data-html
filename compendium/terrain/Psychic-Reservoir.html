		<h1 class="dm">Psychic Reservoir</h1><p class="flavor">Sheltered from the blowing grit, odd violet crystals grow in caverns or rocky terrain. These formations are psychic reservoirs, prized by psionic characters for the latent energy they contain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>With a minor action, a character adjacent to a psychic reservoir can extract the energy from it, causing it to crumble to dust. If that character uses power points, he or she gains 1 power point that lasts until the end of the encounter or until expended. Otherwise, the character adds 5 psychic damage per tier to his or her next damage roll.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Psychic reservoirs add a slight power boost to one side or the other in an encounter. By placing them in scattered spots about the battlefield, you encourage quick action and maneuverability. Psychic reservoirs are particularly valuable in an encounter featuring creatures that are vulnerable to psychic damage.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253880000" target="_new">Dark Sun Creature Catalog</a>, page(s) 136.</p>
