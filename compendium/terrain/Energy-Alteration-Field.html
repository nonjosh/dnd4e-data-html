		<h1 class="dm">Energy Alteration Field</h1><p class="flavor">The air sparkles and the ground buzzes in the area of an energy alteration field. The terrain can be as big as an entire encounter area or as small as a few squares on a side.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a creature within the field makes an attack that has a damage type, or such an attack targets a creature or a square within the field, the attack’s damage type changes. For an attack that has an area of effect, the damage type changes only in the part of the area of effect that overlaps the field.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy alteration fields are inherently chaotic, each one producing a different effect. Use the following table to determine the new damage type, rolling once for each of the attack’s damage types. If the new damage type is the same, nothing happens; an attack that has two or more damage types ends up with only one instead.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>d8</th><th>Energy</th><th>d8</th><th>Energy</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Acid</td><td>5</td><td>Lightning</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cold</td><td>6</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fire</td><td>7</td><td>Radiant</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Force</td><td>8</td><td>Thunder</td></tr></table>Creatures trained in Arcana can manipulate an energy alteration field as a minor action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcana Easy DC: A successful check allows a creature to make one target ignore the effect of the energy alteration field until the end of that target’s next turn. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcana Moderate DC: A successful check allows a creature to change the damage type of its attacks within the field to any other type that the field allows. This effect lasts until the start of the creature’s next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcana Hard DC: A successful check allows a creature to change the damage type of all attacks within the field to any other type that the field allows. This effect lasts until the start of the creature’s next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>An energy alteration field lets characters and monsters alike tinker with their damage types and adds a surprise element to an encounter. It can be key strategic terrain in a battle, allowing a creature that specializes in limited damage types to diversify or to affect creatures that normally have resistance to such damage.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 15.</p>
