		<h1 class="dm">Defiled Ground</h1><p class="flavor">The dead do not always rest in peace. Some cemeteries are darker than others, and ancient events leave unseen traces of their former presence. Defiled ground sometimes attracts undead.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>Undead gain a +1 bonus to rolls to recharge their powers while on defiled ground. In addition, if an undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points while on defiled ground, roll a d20; on a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If radiant damage reduces an undead creature to 0 hit points, it canâ€™t rise again in this manner.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Defiled ground makes undead encounters somewhat more dangerous. Use it for encounters that are meant to have a feel of horror, or to evoke the atmosphere of a site sacred to undead, such as a temple to Orcus.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 59, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/244640000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Kit</a>, page(s) 210.</p>
