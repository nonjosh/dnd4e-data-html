		<h1 class="dm">Doomlight Crystal</h1><p class="flavor">These rare, glowing rock formations exist in the Underdark and deep caverns. The glow comes from the gas inside the crystals, which explodes if it comes in contact with air.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A fist-sized doomlight crystal emits dim yellow light in a 3-square radius. If a character in a square with a doomlight crystal is hit by a close or an area attack, the crystal is destroyed as wellâ€”and the gas inside it explodes, dealing 5 damage per tier to the character in its square.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Obviously, this terrain feature makes area and close attacks more powerful. It can also add an interesting lighting element to a battle if the doomlights are the only source of illumination. As they are destroyed, the battlefield grows darker and darker.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 59.</p>
