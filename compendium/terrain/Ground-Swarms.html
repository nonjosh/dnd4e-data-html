		<h1 class="dm">Ground Swarms</h1><p class="flavor">Various types of vermin crawl through the tunnels of the Feydark, including masses of rats, beetles, tiny drakes, and other nuisance creatures.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ground swarm can occupy a single square or an area up to 3 squares on a side. It can be identified with a DC 20 Nature check.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A ground swarm turns its squares into challenging terrain, requiring a creature that enters the swarm to make an easy Acrobatics check to avoid falling prone. Any living creature that falls prone or starts its turn prone in a ground swarm takes 1 damage per tier (or 2 per tier if bloodied).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ground swarm moves around during combat. Assign the swarm a position in the initiative order (initiative +10) and move it 1d4-1 squares on its turn, typically toward the nearest bloodied combatant.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any blast or burst that includes one or more squares occupied by a ground swarm disperses the swarm in the included squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Using a ground swarm near other hazards or dangerous terrain features can make an encounter more dangerous. For example, consider having a swarm of beetles near a fast-moving stream so that if the characters canâ€™t keep their feet, they end up having to deal with the current.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251210000" target="_new">Underdark</a>, page(s) 100.</p>
