		<h1 class="dm">Hellfire</h1><p class="flavor">Hellfire is a rare flame created by extracting energy from a tortured soul. Found almost exclusively in the Nine Hellsâ€™ deepest reaches, these vile flames burn uncontrollably in areas where souls are gathered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>Whenever a creature that is not a devil enters a square containing hellfire or starts its turn there, it takes ongoing 5 fire and psychic damage per tier (save ends). If the creature is bloodied, the damage increases by 5. In addition, whenever a creature takes ongoing damage from hellfire, the creature cannot take opportunity actions or immediate actions until the start of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Hellfire is common to the Nine Hells and rare elsewhere. Diabolists and those in service to Mephistopheles might know how to create hellfire and use it to ward their lairs.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/34416000" target="_new">The Book of Vile Darkness</a>, page(s) 2-28.</p>
