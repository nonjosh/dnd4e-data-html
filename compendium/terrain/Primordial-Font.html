		<h1 class="dm">Primordial Font</h1><p class="flavor">Volatile fountains of liquid elemental energy can erupt anywhere in the Elemental Chaos, changing those who bathe in them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A creature that remains in a square containing a primordial font for its entire turn gains a random elemental keyword and an accompanying benefit, as shown in the table below. Alternatively, a creature in the font’s square can spend a standard action to splash the liquid over itself, gaining the keyword and the accompanying benefit even if it does not end its turn in the font.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a creature gains a primordial font effect and is already under the effect of a previous result, the prior effect ends. Otherwise, a creature that is under a primordial font’s effect rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. On a result of 9 or lower, the effect ends. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creatures of the elemental origin that are affected by a primordial font can make a saving throw to avoid its effect.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>d6</th><th>Keyword</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Earth</td><td>You gain resist 5 to all damage.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Fire</td><td>You deal 1d6 extra fire damage per tier with melee attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Ice</td><td>Each creature that starts its turn adjacent to you is slowed until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lightning</td><td>Until the start of your next turn, you don’t grant combat advantage or take a -5 penalty to attack rolls when you run.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Thunder</td><td>Each creature that starts its turn adjacent to you is dazed until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Water</td><td>You can shift as a minor action.</td></tr></table><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Primordial fonts create interesting random interactions for monsters and characters alike. You can place them in an encounter when you want a strange and unpredictable battle. Alternatively, primordial fonts are useful in areas containing portals or other restricted zones that are accessible only to creatures that have a certain elemental keyword.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 17.</p>
