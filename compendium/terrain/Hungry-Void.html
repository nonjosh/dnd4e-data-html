		<h1 class="dm">Hungry Void</h1><p class="flavor">Some places in the unending night below sap existence as well as light and warmth. These hungry voids give creatures in them a disorienting feeling of falling away from their bodies. Light cannot dispel this effect because it is the area and not the shadows that unravel the threads of life. A creature in a hungry void is closer to death than elsewhere.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hungry void typically fills an area 5 to 10 squares on a side, but some hungry voids—said to reflect the sites of epic battles in the Underdark—can be much larger. A hungry void can be identified with a DC 20 Dungeoneering check.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>Bright light in a hungry void is automatically reduced to dim. A creature in a hungry void takes a -1 penalty to death saving throws. A bloodied creature that ends its turn in a hungry void square takes 2 necrotic damage per tier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>A hungry void accelerates the slide from bloodied to unconscious to dead, making any dangerous encounter more terrifying for the characters.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251210000" target="_new">Underdark</a>, page(s) 120.</p>
