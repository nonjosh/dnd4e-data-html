		<h1 class="dm">Insect Swarm</h1><p class="flavor">Swarms of biting, sucking insects are found throughout the area, looking for their next source of food. Fresh blood often draws them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a living creature starts its turn within an insect swarm, it takes 5 damage per tier and grants combat advantage until the start of its next turn. Creatures immune to this damage (considered melee damage) do not grant combat advantage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>An insect swarm can serve either as a form of controller in combat (used purposely by the characters’ enemies), or as an unpredictable element in an encounter that changes all the combatants’ tactics. Introduce one or more swarms a few rounds after the start of a fight and have them move to the nearest creature each round.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251260000" target="_new">The Plane Above</a>, page(s) 107.</p>
