		<h1 class="dm">Phase Crystal</h1><p class="flavor">This translucent, silvery crystal is related to phase rock (see Manual of the Planes). It can be induced to discharge its extradimensional energy and shunt a creature out of phase for a short time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When a creature ends its move in a square of phase crystal, it gains phasing until the end of its next turn. That square cannot affect another creature until the end of the encounter.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Combined with obstacles that restrict a battlefield, phase crystal allows characters or monsters greater mobility. You can restrict the terrainâ€™s effect by limiting the number of squares it covers. Try not to use phase crystal as the only way to get to a special area or encounter unless the terrain is large enough to affect the entire party at one time.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 17.</p>
