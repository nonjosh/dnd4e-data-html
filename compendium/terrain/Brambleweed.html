		<h1 class="dm">Brambleweed</h1><p class="flavor">Brambleweed has finger-length thorns, sharp and sturdy enough to rend flesh. The plantâ€™s thick vines spread across an area, hindering any who enter it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>Brambleweed squares are difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn in a brambleweed square takes 5 damage per tier. A creature that ends its turn in a brambleweed square is restrained until the start of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Brambleweed can survive in areas of defiled ground, taking its nutrients from passing creatures rather than the surrounding soil. As a result, defilers use the plant to ward their territory. In the wilds of Athas, shrewd predators and hunters weaken prey by herding it into patches of brambleweed.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253880000" target="_new">Dark Sun Creature Catalog</a>, page(s) 134.</p>
