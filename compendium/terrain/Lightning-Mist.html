		<h1 class="dm">Lightning Mist</h1><p class="flavor">These fields of gray-blue fog that drift slowly through the Elemental Chaos are hazardous to traverse quickly. Lightning mist typically coalesces into an area 5 squares on a side, but masses miles wide and just as deep are not unknown in treacherous territories.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>When the particles within the mist are stirred, a charge of electricity lashes out. Any creature that enters more than 2 squares of lightning mist during a single move action takes 5 lightning damage per tier. Squares containing the mist are lightly obscured.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Lightning mist forces creatures to slow down or suffer the consequences. Artillery monsters zero in on slowly moving creatures within the mist, gaining more attacks at a slight cost to accuracy. Elemental creatures that have resistance or are immune to lightning damage thrive in these areas.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 16.</p>
