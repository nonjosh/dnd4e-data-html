		<h1 class="dm">Insect Cloud</h1><p class="flavor">Swarms of flying, blood-drinking bugs infest the Feydark, searching for targets for their hunger. Though they can survive on carrion and plant sap, they greatly prefer living prey. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An insect cloud can occupy a single square or an area up to 5 squares on a side. It can be identified with a DC 20 Nature check.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>Insect clouds create lightly obscured terrain. Any living creature that starts its turn in an insect cloud takes 1 damage per tier (or 2 per tier if bloodied).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An insect cloud changes position during an encounter. Assign the cloud a position in the initiative order (initiative +10) and move it 1d4-1 squares on its turn, typically toward the nearest bloodied combatant.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any blast or burst that includes one or more squares occupied by an insect cloud disperses the cloud in the included squares.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>As it moves about during combat, an insect cloud adds an element of unpredictability to an encounter. Player characters can also take advantage of the situation by moving enemies into the cloud.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/251210000" target="_new">Underdark</a>, page(s) 100.</p>
