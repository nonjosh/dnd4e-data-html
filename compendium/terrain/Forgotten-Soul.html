		<h1 class="dm">Forgotten Soul</h1><p class="flavor">The legends concerning the Raven Queen’s rise to power suggest there is great power in souls, a power many vile creatures work to exploit. Most souls manage to pass through Letherna’s gates for whatever fate awaits the dead, but a few find their final journey thwarted. Forgotten souls are wretched entities prevented from moving on because they are confused, imprisoned, or waylaid in some other way. Despair consumes them, and they infect the living with their sorrow.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>A forgotten soul typically occupies 1 square. It does not block line of sight or effect, but creatures cannot move through its space.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On initiative count 10, a forgotten soul moves 1 square in a random direction into an unoccupied space.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creatures adjacent to a forgotten soul grant combat advantage and take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. As well, any creature that starts its turn adjacent to a forgotten soul must make a saving throw. On a save, nothing happens. On a failed saving throw, the creature is immobilized until the start of its next turn, and it takes 5 psychic damage per tier.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature can use a melee or a ranged attack to destroy a forgotten soul. The attack hits automatically, and the forgotten soul is removed from play. Forgotten souls are immune to close and area attacks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Usage: </b>Forgotten souls might linger individually or in small packs. They are most often found in dark dominions such as the Nine Hells, Pluton, or Shom, or in the most evil regions in the Shadowfell.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/34416000" target="_new">The Book of Vile Darkness</a>, page(s) 2-28.</p>
