While captured in the crystalline prison, the target is immobilized in a crystal chamber beneath the attacking square of capture crystal. It has just enough space to stand but cannot leave the chamber. It can see out of any square of capture crystal or mirror crystal within 20 squares of it. The target has line of effect to no creature and no creature has line of sight or line of effect to the target (although its image appears in other squares of capture crystal). When the effect ends, the target reappears adjacent to a square of capture crystal within 20 squares of the space it vacated. It cannot be captured again until the end of its next turn.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 18 or Dungeoneering DC :  A character can make a check as a standard action against an adjacent square of capture crystal to disable that square until the end of the encounter.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A square of capture crystal can be attacked.
