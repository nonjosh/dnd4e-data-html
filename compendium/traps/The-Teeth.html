When triggered, the magically infused rocks begin to clash like grinding teeth, attacking characters within the area. The openings between the “teeth” are so tight that Medium and Small characters must squeeze to pass through them.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 27: The character notices old bloodstains on one or more rocky projections.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Dungeoneering</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: The character senses that the rocks in this area are unusual and show signs of recent movement.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Religion</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: (a character who worships the Raven Queen gets a +2 bonus to the check)<br/>The character recognizes the icon of the Raven Queen as connected to the activation of the hazard.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 30: (a character who worships the Raven Queen gets a +2 bonus to the check)<br/>The character understands that an offering of blood at the icon is required to pass the barrier.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Target</span><span class="trapblockbody">When a creature enters or begins its turn in a square of the Teeth, the hazard attacks that creature.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Creature in the square that is not shadar-kai or that has not sworn the pact to the Raven Queen.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+13 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>2d6 + 5 damage</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrobatics DC 27:  A character who makes a successful check can move through the hazard at half speed without provoking the attack.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endurance DC 25:  A character who makes a successful check takes only half damage from an attack.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A character can daub the raven icon with his or her own blood (taking 1d4 damage). This stops the clashing of the Teeth and allows that character to squeeze through without attacks. Other characters are still attacked, even if they enter that character’s square. Returning through the Teeth requires another offering (at the font beside the portal).<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/163" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 163</a>, page(s) 6.</p>
