The pool saps the strength of creatures in it.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No check is necessary to notice the pool.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 17: The character recognizes that the pool and the area around it is hazardous, in addition to being the focus of the concentrated chaos energy suffusing the area.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +7</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The pool triggers when a nonaberrant creature comes within 3 squares of the origin square (marked on the map). When triggered, the hazard makes an attack against the triggering creature. It is no longer active after triggering but recharges slowly over time so that it can retrigger in a subsequent encounter.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 3<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>The triggering creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+6 vs. Will</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>The target is affected by a compulsion to enter the poolâ€™s water (save ends). It moves to the nearest space within the pool as a free action. While under the compulsion, the target remains in the pool and can take no action other than moving to another pool square. Any creature that starts its turn in a pool square loses a healing surge; a creature that has no healing surges remaining instead loses hit points equal to its healing surge value.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 17:  Standard action; the character suppresses the compulsion effect, allowing the affected creature to make a saving throw. If the creature saves, it can move half its speed as a free action.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/177" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 177</a>, page(s) 45.</p>
