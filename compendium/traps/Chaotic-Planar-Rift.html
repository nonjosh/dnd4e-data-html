The hazard typically covers a space at least 10 squares on a side.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change occurs so rapidly and wildly in the area of a chaotic planar rift that an active one is impossible to miss.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 29: The character detects subtle changes in the air and nearby surfaces that herald the imminent opening a chaotic planar rift.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +4</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The trigger of a chaotic planar rift might be random or the result of a living creature first entering the field. Once triggered, the hazard rolls initiative. On its turn, the chaotic planar rift attacks from a random square within its area.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature in burst</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+26 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>Roll a d6 to determine the attack’s effect.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1-Greatsword: </b>2d10 + 8 damage, and one creature adjacent to the target takes 5 damage. The sword then vanishes.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2-Sprouting Tree: </b>1d8 + 5 damage, and the target is knocked prone. One square of the target’s space becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3-Swarm of Acid Toads: </b>2d8 acid damage, and ongoing 10 acid damage (save ends). The toads then burrow into the ground and disappear.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4-Quicksand: </b>The target is restrained (save ends). Aftereffect: The target is immobilized (save ends). A close burst 2 centered on the target is difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5-Stone Casket: </b>Ongoing 10 damage, and the target is entombed within the casket (save ends both). While entombed, the target has line of sight or line of effect to no creature, and no creature has line of sight or line of effect to the target. Other creatures can attack the casket to release the entombed target (AC 5; Reflex 5, Fortitude 10; hp 40).</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>6-Silver Headband: </b>The target gains vulnerable 20 to all damage (save ends).</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Roll a d4 to determine the attack’s effect.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1-Undead Shield: </b>Zombie arms claw free of the ground in the target’s space. When the target moves, the undead arms move with it. They do not attack the target. The next attack against the target hits the arms instead, and they dissolve into dust.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2-Refreshed: </b>The target regains a healing surge and, if expended, its second wind.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3-Simulacrum: </b>A duplicate of the target appears 1d6 squares away from it. On the target’s next turn, both it and the simulacrum take actions simultaneously; these actions need not be the same. The simulacrum can make attacks just as the original can. The simulacrum then vanishes.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4-Roots and Branches: </b>Grasping vegetation fills a close burst 3 centered on the target; +28 vs. AC; 1d12+6 damage, and the target is grabbed (escape DC 33).</span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 23.</p>
