The hazard occupies an area at least 10 squares on a side; random squares within the area attack.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 24: The character notices an array of cracks running throughout the surface and sees that certain blocks bounded by the cracks twist and shudder.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Nature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 29: As Perception, above.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +2</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The trigger for a skystone field can be random, caused by the actions of creatures, or timed. When the field is triggered, it rolls initiative. Between the triggering of the field and its attack, characters in the area know that something is amiss—different bits of ground in the area begin to vibrate and twitch violently. On the field’s turn, a random square within the skystone field is the origin of a close burst attack. The same square cannot attack more than once in an encounter.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature in burst</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+22 vs. Reflex; two attacks</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>The target is flung 30 feet into the air, then falls back down. It takes 3d10 damage and falls prone in a random square within 3 squares of its starting position.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>The target slides to an unoccupied square adjacent to the burst. If no such square is available, the attack hits automatically.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Effect: </b>The burst creates an area of difficult terrain.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature DC 29:  With a Nature check as a minor action, a character can determine the square on which the hazard will center its attack during its next turn.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 22 or Thievery DC 22:  A character who knows which square of the hazard will attack next can attempt an Arcana check or Thievery check as a standard action. On a successful check, the character stabilizes that square so that the hazard does not attack in that round.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
