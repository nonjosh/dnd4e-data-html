Nothing comes through the gate, but those who look at the horrors of the Far Realm put their sanity at risk.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 29: The character sees a flicker indicating which two gates will open the following round.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 33: The character recognizes the Far Realm and knows it’s not safe to look at.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +8</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The gates open and close at initiative point 0.

Complexity 1 (4 successes before 3 failures). Success causes that gate to stay dark even when it would be randomly triggered. Failure causes the gate to explode (close burst 8, 4d10 + 5 radiant damage and stunned (save ends) to all creatures in burst). The third failure sucks the character into the Far Realm, where he remains until someone rescues him—an adventure in its own right.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the gate framework (AC 33, other defenses 29; hp 100; resist 15 all). When reduced to 0 hit points, the gate explodes in a close burst 8, as above.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/175" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 175</a>, page(s) 36.</p>
