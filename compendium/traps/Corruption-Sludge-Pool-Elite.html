Serpentine forms disturb the fetid pool, revealing a flash of fang or a glimpse of bulging eye.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Hazard:</b> These brackish, pulsating puddles of hate, madness, and decay inundate the lower regions of the Abyss. They occur less frequently in other parts of the Elemental Chaos and on other planes. Sludge pools are typically 5 squares on a side but can grow larger, especially in the most dangerous parts of the Abyss.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No check is required to notice the pool.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 28: The character recognizes the hazard’s nature.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +2</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">At the start of the encounter, roll initiative for the hazard. It makes a lashing tendril attack once each round when creatures are within reach. When any creature enters the pool’s area or begins its turn there, the hazard makes a sludge latch attack.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Lashing Tendril Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 3<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>One nondemon creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+33 vs. Reflex, two attacks</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d8 +6 acid damage, and ongoing 15 acid damage (save ends).

On a hit (all the tendril’s defenses are 40), the hazard can’t make lashing tendril attacks (save ends). A separate readied action is required to attack and suppress each tendril.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 23.</p>
