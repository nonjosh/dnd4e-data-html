First Failed Saving Throw: The target is still dominated, but it is no longer dazed as part of that condition. The cacodemon chooses all the dominated target’s actions. Second Failed Saving Throw: The cacodemon possesses the target (see “Demon-Possessed,” below). The possession ends when the target dies or the cacodemon is exorcised (see “Countermeasures” below).</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>The cacodemon manifests as a misty essence in a square adjacent to the target. While in this form, the cacodemon can attack only creatures adjacent to it or in its square. Any creature can move through the cacodemon’s square freely. The cacodemon cannot move or be attacked or damaged. The hazard makes a saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a save, this effect ends.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a cacodemon’s square comes within the protected area of a Forbiddance ritual, the cacodemon becomes inert until the end of the ritual. If the level of the cacodemon’s previous form is higher than the ritual caster’s level, Forbiddance has no effect on the cacodemon.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can exorcise a cacodemon possessing a creature by performing the Remove Affliction ritual. The cacodemon cannot attack the formerly possessed creature again for a year and a day. The affliction’s level is the level of the cacodemon’s previous form.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the cacodemon is in its mist form, any creature adjacent to it that is trained in Arcana or Religion can make a check with one of those skills (hard DC by level). A successful check forces the cacodemon into a construct, a Magic Circle, or a magic item within 5 squares of the cacodemon.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253860000" target="_new">Demonomicon</a>, page(s) 12.</p>
