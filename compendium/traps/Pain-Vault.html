With each failed check, the trap makes the following attack. Each attempt to disable a lock takes a standard action. With each success or failure, another attempt to disable a lock must be made before the end of the attempting creature’s next turn, or a failure in the challenge is accrued. On the third failure all the locks reset, requiring the skill challenge to be performed anew, but ending the immediate threat.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Necrotic, Psychic</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Immediate Reaction</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> blast 5<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature in blast</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+21 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>2d6 + 7 necrotic damage, and the target takes ongoing 10 psychic damage and a –2 penalty to ability checks and skill checks (save ends both).</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 22:  A character can ready a standard action to make a check when someone fails a Thievery check during the skill challenge to open the pain vault.

If it is destroyed, the trap is disabled.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 72.</p>
