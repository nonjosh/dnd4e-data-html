For the purpose of that attack, the heart has Will 30. On a hit, the trap is disabled for 1 hour and ends its attacks on all creatures that previously triggered it. On a miss, the heart makes a special attack: close burst 20; +21 vs. Fortitude; on a hit, 2d6 cold damage.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can destroy the heart by hitting it with a single attack that deals at  least 50 acid, fire, or radiant damage. Any attack against the heart automatically hits it, but the trap makes another attack against the triggering creature if the trap is not destroyed by that attack.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
