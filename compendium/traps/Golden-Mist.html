Second Failed Saving Throw: The target becomes controlled by the trap and gains the chaotic evil alignment.

A character can make a DC 24 Perception check to identify the correct runes only after he or she is aware that the trap exists. Once the runes are identified, a character can make a DC 25 Arcana check or Thievery check while in location 19 to disable the trap.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the trap is disabled, each dominated and trap-controlled individual can make a saving throw with a +5 bonus. On a save, the creature is no longer dominated or controlled, and its alignment and behavior return to normal. On a failed saving throw, the creature continues to attack prior allies, and only a Remove Affliction ritual can negate the effect.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A successful use of dispel magic against a Will of 30 causes the mist to instantly disappear, and its domination and control effects end.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 107.</p>
