If the check is successful, the hazard becomes inactive until the end of the character’s next turn. An arcane character who has no arcane defiling feats (see the Dark Sun Campaign Setting) gains a +2 bonus to this check; other characters take a -2 penalty for each arcane defiling feat they have. If a preserver spends two healing surges after making this check, he or she destroys the hazard. Healing surges spent in this manner can be regained only through an extended rest.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253880000" target="_new">Dark Sun Creature Catalog</a>, page(s) 142.</p>
