As a standard action, a character on top of the obelisk who makes a DC 21 Athletics check or Thievery check can open the eye.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack either the iron eye (AC 22, other defenses 20, hp 60, resist 5 all) or the obelisk itself (AC 18, other defenses 18, hp 90, resist 10 all). If either one is reduced to 0 hit points, the trap is destroyed.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
