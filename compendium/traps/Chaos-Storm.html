Each round on its turn, the origin square of the zone slides 2d6 squares in a random direction as a move action. The storm has the following effects on creatures and objects in its burst:</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A creature teleports 1d6 squares in a random direction(roll 1d8 to determine direction) and takes 2d12 psychic damage. Slaads are immune to this effect.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>An unattended object that is not native to the Elemental Chaos is teleported as if it were a creature.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A significant terrain feature, made of a singular elementalsubstance or energy and entirely contained within the burst, is transformed into a different kind of elemental substance or energy (DM’s discretion). For example, a floating chunk of ice engulfed by the storm might become a ball of fire or an orb of acid. A geyser of acid could become a gout of cold or a spray of magma. The general effects of the terrain feature might remain similar or change dramatically, at the DM’s option.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligence DC 20:  A character can attempt a check as a standard action to ward off the effects of the storm. On a success, the character becomes stabilized and is immune to the storm’s teleportation and damage until the start of the character’s next turn.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 67.</p>
