This requires a successful check. Failure means the character did not pass underneath before the bars swung down, and that character is attacked. Failure by 5 or more means the character is hit automatically by the attack (no roll required).<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 27:  Standard action. An adjacent character can slow a gate’s fall, granting a +4 on Acrobatics checks to move under the gate.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athletics DC 25:  A character can climb the wall to move adjacent to the line in the ceiling.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 32:   1 minute. A character adjacent to the line in the ceiling can disable a gate.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athletics DC 32:  Move action. A character can push the portcullis up, move 1 square into its space, and hold it until it attacks. The character takes 3d10 + 6 force damage when initiating this action (success or failure), and is subject to the trap’s attack.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/160" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 160</a>, page(s) 79.</p>
