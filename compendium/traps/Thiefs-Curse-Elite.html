A dragon that makes use of a thief’s curse might wait until intruders trigger the trap. If the dragon takes this approach, it hangs back just out of range, allowing the trap to do its work. Meanwhile, the dragon breathes and makes melee attacks against those who try to flee.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: The character notices the tiny runes etched on the art that indicate it has magical properties.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 30: The character knows what the runes signify.

Each target takes a -2 penalty to each of its saving throws to end the immobilized and restrained effects. On its first failed saving throw, an immobilized target is restrained. On its second failed saving throw, the target is petrified. (The target becomes gold, but the gold corrodes into worthlessness within 24 hours. This is normal petrification in all other respects.)</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Half damage, and the target is slowed until the end of its next turn.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Special </b>Destroying or deactivating the trap does not reverse petrifi cation, which requires the Remove Affliction ritual.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 30:  An adjacent character can attempt to mar the runes on the art, disrupting the magic, with a check.
