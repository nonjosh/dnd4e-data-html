On the trap’s turn, randomly determine which part of the machine the bolt of energy originates from (roll a d4), and which of the two parts the bolt travels toward.

The trap first attacks each creature occupying a square on the path of dashed lines, and then attacks each creature in a burst 2 around the second part.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">First Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 6<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature occupying a square on the path connecting the two parts of the machine</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+5 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d8 + 3 lightning and necrotic damage, and the target is weakened until the end of the trap’s next turn.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Second Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 2<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature in burst</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+5 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d8 + 3 thunder damage, and the target is knocked prone.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Half damage.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 10:  A character adjacent to one of the squares where the bolts of energy originate can drain some of the force from the energy by making a successful check as a standard action.
