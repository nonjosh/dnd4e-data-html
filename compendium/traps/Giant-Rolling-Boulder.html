It begins rolling down the hall, crushing everything in its path.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Trap:</b> A trigger you define releases a distant boulder that begins rolling toward the trigger area, and it rolls until stopped.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 23: A character near the distant false wall can determine that it is thin and that a large space is behind it.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 28: A character realizes that the trigger is in tension and that setting it off releases something.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Speed</b> 8(consider altering this based on the length of the roll and the PCs’ speeds)</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The trigger might be an enemy pulling on a lever, a character pressing the wrong button, or someone taking the gem from a statue’s eye. When the trap is triggered, roll initiative. On its initiative count, the boulder moves.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action or Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> trample attack in squares entered by the boulder<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Trample: </b>Each turn, the boulder moves its speed and enters creatures’ spaces. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The boulder can end its move in an occupied space. Creatures in the boulder’s space at the start of their turns have cover and can act normally. When the boulder enters a creature’s space, the boulder makes a trample attack. If a creature enters a square of the boulder’s space, the boulder makes a trample attack as a free action.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Trample Attack: </b>+17 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>3d10 + 6 damage, and the target is knocked prone.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Half damage.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athletics DC 28:  A character adjacent to the rolling boulder can stop it with a successful check. Making this attempt provokes a trample attack as an immediate interrupt, and the character’s Athletics check fails if the boulder’s trample attack hits.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 23:  A character adjacent to the trigger (or the location from where the trigger is activated) can delay the trigger with a successful check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 23:  A character adjacent to the boulder before it begins to roll can disable the trap with a successful check. The character must have broken through the false wall first (AC 4, Fortitude 12, Reflex 4; hp 30).<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 69.</p>
