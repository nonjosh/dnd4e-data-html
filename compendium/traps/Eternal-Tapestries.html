Each 5-foot section of the tapestry has AC 29, other defenses of 27, and 10 hit points. A section of tapestry caught by an area attack takes damage to each of its squares.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 67.</p>
