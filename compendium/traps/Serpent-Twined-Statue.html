The trap takes a cumulative -2 penalty to its initiative count and makes an attack roll each time such a check succeeds. On the third successful check, the trap is disabled.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the trap to mar the runes (AC/Reflex 2; Fortitude 38; hp 150), but doing so grants the trap a +2 bonus to its next attack roll against the attacker. The attacker feels the energy of the trap flow toward him or her. Reducing the runes to 0 hit points disables the trap but does not destroy it.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 104.</p>
