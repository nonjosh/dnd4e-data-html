When it does, the hazard rolls initiative. The mass moves on its turn, oozing through the air or dragging along the surface to a square occupied by a nondemon living creature. It has a speed of 5, fly 5 (hover). It then attacks such creatures that start their turns within its area.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each nondemon living creature that starts its turn in the voidblight’s square</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+18 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d10 + 6 psychic damage, and ongoing 10 psychic damage and the target is affected by voidblight insanity (save ends both). While a conscious target is affected by the insanity, it must make a basic attack against an ally during its turn or take 10 extra psychic damage at the end of its turn.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Special: </b>A creature cannot make a saving throw against the voidblight’s effect while within the hazard’s square.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack a square of voidblight (AC 29; other defenses 27; hp 30; half damage from melee and ranged attacks).
