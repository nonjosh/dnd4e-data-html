A successful check or an attack that does more than 15 damage reduces the hazard’s attack bonus by 2. After a combination of three such successful checks or attacks, the menhir tumbles over and the hazard’s effect ends. The menhir’s space becomes difficult terrain.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218637400" target="_new">H3 Pyramid of Shadows</a>, page(s) 47.</p>
