Preventing the door from sealing causes the room to fill with blood in twice as many rounds; use the round 1 result on round 2, use the round 2 result on round 4, and so on.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strength DC 31:  A character adjacent to a closed door can attempt to break it down with a successful check or by attacking it (AC 5; Fortitude 10, Reflex 5; hp 80).<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 33:  A character adjacent to the skull can turn off the flow of blood by gaining four successes before three failures, using either Arcana or Thievery. A character who fails a check takes 15 necrotic damage.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/241917400" target="_new">E2 Kingdom of the Ghouls</a>, page(s) 55.</p>
