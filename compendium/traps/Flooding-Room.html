Eighteen grates open near the ceiling, allowing murky water from the canals to begin pouring into the room. The room fills at the rate of 1 foot every 2 rounds, filling completely in 24 rounds. After 1 hour, a hidden locked grate in the floor opens and allows the water to drain out at a rate of 1 foot every 4 rounds.
