While the target is dominated, it makes at-will attacks against its allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aftereffect: A hazy eldritch simulacrum of the target appears in a square adjacent to it. The duplicate is functionally identical to the target, possessing all its weapons and gear. A simulacrum is immune to the effect of the Devourer. A simulacrum and its gear are destroyed when it is reduced to 0 hit points.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eldritch simulacrum rolls initiative when it appears, entering combat in the following round. The Devourer can create more than one simulacrum of the same character, but can’t create more than four simulacra in total.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an immediate interrupt, a character in the burst can make a DC 27 Acrobatics check to minimize the effect of the Devourer’s attack. With a successful check, the character takes half damage if the Devourer hits, and the character is not dominated. The character takes no damage if the Devourer misses.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters can engage in a skill challenge to disable the trap: DC 22 Arcana or Thievery; complexity 2 (requires 6 successes before 3 failures); success safely disables the trap; failure disables the trap but causes an explosion of arcane essence: close burst 10; on a hit, 4d10 damage, and the target loses a healing surge.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can make a DC 22 Athletics check or Acrobatics check to leap or climb onto the Devourer. A character doing so is subject to an extra attack by the trap (an immediate reaction), but that character gains a +2 bonus to Thievery checks and Arcana checks while he or she remains on the Devourer.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters must attack the Devourer to destroy it. The great stone face has Fortitude 33, other defenses 29, and 300 hit points. If the Devourer is destroyed before being disabled, it makes one last attack with a +5 bonus to the attack roll. If the trap is disabled first, the Devourer can be destroyed without causing it to make this final attack.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the trap is disabled, the characters can make a DC 28 Athletics check to move the Devourer aside and reveal the opening beyond. (The stone image is large enough for up to four characters to provide aid on this check.)<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 111.</p>
