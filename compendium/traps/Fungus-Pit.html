Doing so grants a +2 bonus to Fortitude against the hazard’s primary attack.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a running start, a character can make a DC 30 Athletics check to jump the pit. On a failed check, a character falls prone in the pit, taking 3d10 damage and triggering the hazard.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can make a DC 25 Athletics check to climb the walls above the pit. On a failed check, a character falls prone in the pit, taking 2d10 damage and triggering the hazard.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attempt to cross the pit on a rope, but the corridor offers nowhere to anchor it. Two characters on opposite sides of the pit can anchor a rope for a character to pull himself or herself across. Each anchoring character makes a DC 13 Athletics check; the moving character makes a DC 18 Athletics check. If any character fails a check, the moving character falls prone in the pit, taking 2d10 damage and triggering the hazard.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can make a DC 20 Athletics check to climb out of the pit.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 70.</p>
