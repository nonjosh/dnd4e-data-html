If the check succeeds, the altar makes an attack (as above) that targets its allies rather than its enemies. The altar cannot make another attack until after the end of the character’s turn. With three successful Religion checks, the altar is destroyed.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the altar (AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10, 40 hit points). Destroying the altar ends its threat.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253860000" target="_new">Demonomicon</a>, page(s) 37.</p>
