A failed check indicates that the attack occurs as described above.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception DC 23:  A character can find a mechanism beneath the platform on the east side of the chamber with a successful Perception check. The mechanism, a combination of magic and gearworks, controls the intake/outtake cycle of the pipes. A successful Arcana or Thievery check disables one of the pipes (determined randomly). A failed check causes all of the pipes to make an immediate attack on any creatures within or adjacent to the trapped spaces. With the third successful check, all of the pipes shut down.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218637400" target="_new">H3 Pyramid of Shadows</a>, page(s) 9.</p>
