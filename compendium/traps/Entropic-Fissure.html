The target returns from the Far Realms as a shifting and mutating version of its former self. It is helpless until a Remove Affliction ritual can be performed, at which point the target is no longer helpless and reverts to its former form.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 29:  A character who is trained in Arcana can engage in a skill challenge to banish the fissure: complexity 2 (6 successes before 3 failures); each check is a standard action. Success banishes the fissure. Failure causes it to split into two unstable fissures occupying adjacent squares. Each round, at the end of each unstable fissure’s turn, it rolls a saving throw. On a failed saving throw, an unstable fissure winks out of existence.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 24.</p>
