Each successful check imposes a -2 penalty to the trap’s attack rolls. With three successful checks, the mirror of madness is permanently disabled.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the mirror (AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10, 40 hit points). Whenever the trap is hit by an attack, each creature within 5 squares of it takes 5 psychic damage. Destroying the mirror ends this trap’s threat.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253860000" target="_new">Demonomicon</a>, page(s) 37.</p>
