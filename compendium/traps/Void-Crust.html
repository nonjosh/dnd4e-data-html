Suddenly, the ground opens to expose a roiling void.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Hazard:</b> When a creature within the hazard acts violently, the area beneath the creature gives way, dropping it into a seething void below. A void crust typically occupies 20 to 30 contiguous squares, each of which must share a side, not just a corner, with at least one other void crust square.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 24: The character notices that the area ahead is treacherous and fragile.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">If a creature attempts to move out of a square of void crust without shifting, makes an attack while in a square of void crust, or is hit by an attack while in a square of void crust, the hazard attacks.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>The triggering creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+25 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d8 + 3 damage, and the target disappears into the void. It instantly reappears 20 feet above a random square 1d4-1 squares away and falls back to the surface, taking 2d10 damage. If the creature falls into its original space, it again takes damage and disappears into the void, falling again in another square.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>The target slides to an unoccupied adjacent square. If no such square is available, the attack hits automatically.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Effect: </b>The space vacated by the target remains open to the void. A creature forced into the opening can try to catch itself by attempting a saving throw before falling in. If it fails the saving throw, it is automatically hit by the void crustâ€™s attack.</span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
