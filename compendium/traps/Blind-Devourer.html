Up to two characters adjacent to the mouth can aid this check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sphere of darkness cannot be controlled or destroyed, but it can be disabled temporarily in the course of activating the exit from this location. A character can make a DC 25 Athletics check or make a melee weapon attack vs. AC 31 that deals 10 or more damage to break the carved stone of one of the Devourer’s blind eyes. The character who breaks the stone takes 1d10 damage from arcane feedback, but the sphere is disabled while the Devourer’s open eye is revealed. The stone that covers the area magically re-forms, restoring the blind eye in 1 round.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If two characters break both eyes simultaneously, neither character takes damage, the sphere of annihilation is disabled for 1 minute, and a portal opens beneath it. Characters who lower themselves into the Devourer’s mouth drop 20 feet into location 2, taking falling damage as normal. Characters can lower a rope down to avoid this damage, but the rope is severed when the sphere of annihilation reactivates.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253850000" target="_new">Tomb of Horrors</a>, page(s) 65.</p>
