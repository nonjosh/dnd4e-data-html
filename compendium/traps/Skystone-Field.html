When the field is triggered, it rolls initiative. Between the triggering of the field and its attack, characters in the area know that something is amiss—different bits of ground in the area begin to vibrate and twitch violently. On the field’s turn, a random square within the skystone field is the origin of a close burst attack. The same square cannot attack more than once in an encounter.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 1<br/></span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature DC 27:  With a Nature check as a minor action, a character can determine the square on which the hazard will center its attack during its next turn.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 22 or Thievery DC 22:  A character who knows which square of the hazard will attack next can attempt an Arcana check or Thievery check as a standard action. On a successful check, the character stabilizes that square so that the hazard does not attack in that round.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
