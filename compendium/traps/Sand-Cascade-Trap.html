		<h1 class="trap">Sand Cascade Trap<br/><span class="type">Trap</span><br/><span class="level">Level 4 Obstacle<br/><span class="xp">XP 175</span></span></h1><p class="flavor"><i>Hatches within the wall alcoves open, releasing jets of fine, powdery sand, which spreads out into the middle of the room then slides down the slope toward you.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Trap:</b> The sand adds difficult terrain, slides the PCs south, and can ensnare them in the floor crevasse. In the first round, hatches open in the westernmost alcove (numbered 1) on each side. In each subsequent round, the next higher-numbered pair of hatches (immediately to the east) opens, increasing the flow of sand. One round after the sixth pair opens, all hatches close again. By the end of that round, nearly all the sand has slipped down the crevasse, leaving only a trace behind.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 12: The character notices wall panels on the back of each alcove to the north and south.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 17: The character notices grooves in the floor that indicate the skull will swivel in place. The character must be within 2 squares to notice.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +6</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The trap starts spewing sand from the westernmost openings when a creature adjacent to the skull rotates it (a minor action). Roll initiative; on the trapâ€™s first turn, it begins spewing sand. On its next turn it begins attacking any eligible targets, and at the end of each of its turns beginning in round 2 the next pair of hatches opens.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature even with or west of the easternmost open hatch.<br/>Attack in rounds 2 and 3: +5 vs. Fortitude; the target slides 2 squares due west.<br/>Attack in rounds 4 and 5: +7 vs. Fortitude; the target slides 4 squares due west.<br/>Attack in rounds 6 and 7: +9 vs. Fortitude, the target slides 6 squares due west.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Effect </b>All squares between the easternmost open hatches and the crevasse are difficult terrain.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Effect </b>Creatures pushed into the crevasse are buried in sand up to their waist and are restrained (save at -2 penalty ends).</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 12 or Thievery (if the hatch is already open) DC 17:  A character can jam an adjacent hatch closed with a successful check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 17:  The characters can engage in a skill challenge to deactivate the trigger at the skull. Complexity 1 (4 successes before 3 failures). A character must be adjacent to the skull in order to attempt a check in this skill challenge. Success on the skill challenge disables the trap. Each failure recorded while attempting the skill challenge causes the sand to pour out faster, granting the trap a +1 bonus on attack rolls. If the skill challenge results in failure, no further checks made for this purpose have any effect.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951390" target="_new">Dungeon Delve</a>, page(s) 31.</p>
