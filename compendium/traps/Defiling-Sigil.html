Then roll the sigil’s initiative. It acts each round on its turn until no creature is within the trigger area.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Necrotic</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Immediate Reaction or Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 5<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>One creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+5 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d6 + 1 damage, and the target is restrained and takes ongoing 3 necrotic damage (save ends).</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Special: </b>The sigil can restrain only one target at one time. The sigil attacks a restrained target until the target escapes or drops to 0 hit points. If the latter occurs, a wisp wraith forms over the target’s body and attacks living intruders in the room. The sigil attacks another creature in range or waits to be triggered again.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrobatics DC 20 or Athletics DC 20:  A restrained character can use an escape action (DC 20 check) to free himself and end the ongoing necrotic damage.<br/>First Failed Escape Check: The ongoing necrotic damage is instead 6.<br/>Each Subsequent Failed Escape Check: The ongoing necrotic damage increases by 3 (to a maximum of 15).<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 20 or Thievery DC 20:  As a standard action, a creature adjacent to the sigil can disrupt the enchantment with a skill check. Doing so renders the sigil inert until the start of that creature’s next turn and releases all currently restrained creatures.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the sigil (AC and other defenses 10, resist 5 all, hp 25). Reducing the sigil to 0 hit points destroys the trap.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253890000" target="_new">Marauders of the Dune Sea</a>, page(s) 21.</p>
