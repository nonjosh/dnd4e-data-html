When activated, the mist takes on a sickly bluish hue, somewhere between the flicker of the lightning and the fading edges of an ugly bruise.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Hazard:</b> A volatile haze occasionally forms in an area of high mystical energy concentration, such as a dragonâ€™s lair. A faint haze in a 10-square burst, hanging at roughly calf level on a human, absorbs the energy given off by characters within it and then launches that energy back at those characters.<br/>When the hazard is triggered, it takes on a crackling blue hue, and a ball of energy forms in the square at the center of the burst. An active haze does not change damage types with future attacks or spells; it retains its initial type until deactivated or until 24 hours pass.<br/>A dragon fortunate enough to accumulate a volatile haze might wait until intruders have entered the haze and then breathe, knowing that the haze will continue to attack for it. Dragons even fi ght within the haze, counting on their own resistance to protect them.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 23: The character notices the faint haze near the floor.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 28: The character recognizes the mist for what it is.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +12</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">A creature within the haze uses or is attacked by a cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder eff ect. The haze makes an attack instantly and then rolls initiative.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Immediate Reaction or Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Area</b> burst 10<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>All creatures in or adjacent to squares with haze</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+15 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>4d6 + 14 damage, and the target is dazed until the end of its next turn. Damage is the same type as that of the trigger effect.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Half damage, and the target is not dazed.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrobatics DC 23:  A character at the edge of the mist or in a targeted adjacent square when the haze attacks can attempt a check as an immediate interrupt. If successful, that character takes half damage and immediately moves to the nearest untargeted square.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the ball of energy at the center of the haze, which has AC 23, Fortitude 23, Reflex 23, Will 23, and 130 hit points and is immune to the damage type it uses to attack. If destroyed, the haze makes a fi nal attack and then dies. It remains inert for 24 hours, after which time another energy attack can activate it.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217887200" target="_new">Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons</a>, page(s) 50.</p>
