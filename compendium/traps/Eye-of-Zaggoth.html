The character discerns the area that the next blast targets.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 32:  Standard action. The character works to detach the eye from the pedestal. Four successful checks are required to remove the eye and disable the trap.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A character can attack the eye (AC 43, Defenses 40; hp 400). When reduced to 0 hit points, the eye explodes in a close burst 5, attacking every creature in the area with Attack 2 (version 6, petrification). However, the petrified condition on this version of that attack allows no save. Destroying the eye disables the trap.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/160" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 160</a>, page(s) 86.</p>
