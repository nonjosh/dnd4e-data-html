When a creature steps within 5 squares of the false demilich, it rises into the air and starts draining souls into its soul gems.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: The character spots the jewel-studded skull.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Religion</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 31: The character knows of demiliches: an animated skull festooned with costly gems, which gleam wickedly with the light of trapped souls. Despite the implication of its name, a demilich is more deadly than a normal lich.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 34: The character recognizes the skull as a false demilich, understanding that it make use of a demilich’s soul gems.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Thievery</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 34: The character recognizes the skull as a false demilich, understanding that it make use of a demilich’s soul gems.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +13</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">When a creature moves within 5 squares of the false demilich, it rolls initiative and attacks.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>One creature, preferentially targeting an arcane, primal, martial, or divine character (in that order), or any character that last caused it damage.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+25 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>The target is dazed and restrained (save ends both). First Failed Saving Throw: The target is instead stunned and restrained (save ends both). Second Failed Saving Throw: The target dies, their physical body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders away, and its soul is trapped in one of the false demilich’s soul gems until the false demilich is destroyed; see also the “Fate of Drained Souls” sidebar.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Special </b>The false demilich’s six soul gems can each hold the soul of one of its victims. When the false demilich is destroyed, each soul gem must succeed on a saving throw or be destroyed as well (along with the soul it contains). Crushing a surviving soul gem after the false demilich is destroyed releases the soul to a material body within 2 squares, if one is available to receive it (a simulacrum, a clone, or a soulless body of some sort), or else the soul is released into the Shadowfell. Surviving gems can be recovered: the two jewels set into the eye sockets (5,000 gp rubies), and its soul gems, 6 pointed (marquis cut) diamonds set as teeth in the jaw (each diamond worth 500 gp).</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character might attack the false demilich (AC 33, other defenses 32; hp 50), but only certain specific actions will affect it, as follows:<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A martial character using a vorpal weapon or a sword drawn from a sapphire scabbard, a paladin using a +4 or better magic weapon, or any character using a holy avenger can attack the false demilich and inflict damage as normal on a successful hit.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rogue using a gem (including astral diamonds) as a sling stone inflicts 1 damage per 10,000 gp value of the stone on a successful hit. On a hit, the gem shatters. On a miss, the gem must succeed on a saving throw, also shattering on failure.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful use of the following items or powers do not cause damage as normal but instead inflict 5 damage to the false demilich: warlock’s eyebite, cleric’s sacred word, an item or power with the thunder keyword, or an item or power with both the divine and radiant keywords.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful use of a cleric’s command or purify, a wizard’s confusion, or a ring of forgetful touch will cause the false demilich to sink down without attacking. It can still be triggered again as normal.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/371" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 371</a>, page(s) 66.</p>
