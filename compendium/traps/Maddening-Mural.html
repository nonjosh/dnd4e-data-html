Images of vegetation hide eyes, mouths, and claws, and the shapes themselves start to twist into horrid monstrosities that reach out from the mural, lashing at your sanity.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Trap:</b> This strange painting threatens the sanity of those who wander too close.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No check is needed to notice the painting.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 19: A character more than 10 squares away sees that the images in the painting twist and writhe. Something is definitely strange about the painting.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 33: The character identifies the painting as a maddening mural and knows the risks of getting too close to it.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The trap is triggered when an enemy ends its turn within 10 squares of the painting. The trap’s psychic attack then lashes out at the creature in an attempt to snare and devour its sanity.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Psychic</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>The creature that triggered the trap</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+32 vs. Will</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>2d8 + 10 psychic damage, and the target’s sanity is entrapped within the painting. While the target’s sanity is entrapped, the target is dazed and slowed and can spend actions in only the following three ways:</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stumble Away (Move Action): </b>The entrapped creature cannot run.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fight the Painting (Standard Action): </b>The entrapped creature can make any at-will attack against the painting. The attack deals damage to the painting’s physical statistics (see Countermeasures).</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Free Itself (Standard Action): </b>A DC 19 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check frees the creature from the entrapment. When a creature frees itself from the prison, it is still dazed until the start of its next turn.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 28 or Thievery DC 28:  An entrapped character who is trained in Arcana or Thievery can use a standard action to attempt to disable the painting. A successful skill check gains 1 success on a complexity 1 skill challenge (4 successes before 3 failures). After 4 successes, the painting is disabled. After 3 failures, each entrapped character takes 3d8 +10 psychic damage, and the skill challenge must be started again.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The painting can be attacked. It has AC 20, Reflex 20, Fortitude 30, and hp 300.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 74.</p>
