It devours creatures, then spits them back out as horrid abominations. The entropic nexus fills an area 3 squares on a side.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception cannot be used to notice this hazard before it appears. Once the entropic nexus appears above the altar, no check is necessary to notice it.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 24: A character can identify the entropic nexus once it appears.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +23</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The entropic nexus appears and rolls initiative when any creature except a slaad moves adjacent to the altar.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Move</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody">The entropic nexus slides 6 squares toward the nearest nonslaad each round.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> reach 3<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>A living creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Primary Attack: </b>+29 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>3d10 + 5 damage, and the target is grabbed and pulled into a square adjacent to the entropic nexus. On each of its subsequent turns, the entropic nexus deals 3d10 + 5 damage to targets that it has grabbed. The nexus can grab up to eight targets at a time. Make a secondary attack against each grabbed and bloodied target.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Secondary Attack: </b>+29 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit: </b>The target is pulled into the Far Realm and removed from play. At the end of the nexusâ€™s next turn, the target appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the nexus. The target returns from the Far Realm as a misshapen and horrid version of its former self. It is helpless until a Remove Affliction ritual can be performed, at which point the target is no longer helpless and reverts to its former form.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 31:  A character who is trained in Arcana can engage in a skill challenge to banish the nexus: complexity 1 (4 successes before 3 failures); each check is a standard action. Success in the challenge banishes the nexus. Failure in the challenge causes it to split into two unstable nexuses that occupy adjacent spaces. Each round, each unstable nexus rolls a saving throw at the end of its turn. On a failed saving throw, an unstable nexus winks out of existence.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/174" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 174</a>, page(s) 40.</p>
