		<h1 class="trap">Elemental Tiles<br/><span class="type">Trap</span><br/><span class="level">Level 16  Obstacle<br/><span class="xp">XP 1400</span></span></h1><p class="flavor"><i>The area is riddled with floor tiles that transform before your eyes. At times, each tile resembles stone that ripples like water; then it transforms to boiling ice. Later the tile dances with a flame-colored mist that crackles before it grows into spikes of lightning. Whatever these tiles are, they don’t look stable.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Trap:</b> Each of these traps has eight strategically placed tiles, and whenever a creature enters a tile space, it is attacked by a random form of elemental energy. Also, when creatures are in close proximity to the tiles, every so often a random tile erupts, spewing an area with hazardous elemental energy. This trap has two triggers and two attacks.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Perception check is needed to notice the tiles, because they are readily apparent.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: The character notices a focus device located in an out-of-the-way place. The device likely controls the magic of the tiles.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 25: The character realizes that the tiles are channeling the energy of the Elemental Chaos, and each does so in a dangerously unstable way.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 30: The character recognizes the focus device as a chaos stone—the controlling focus for this type of trap— which can be overloaded with the right kind of attacks or through careful manipulation. Successful manipulation requires a character to use the same energy that the tiles spew during the round in which that character attempts to manipulate the focus device.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger 1</span><span class="trapblockbody">A creature enters a square that contains an elemental tile. The trap then makes the following attack.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Varies</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>The creature that triggered the trap</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+19 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>2d8 + 7 damage of a type determined by a d6 roll (1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; 6, thunder damage), and the target is slowed (save ends).</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger 2</span><span class="trapblockbody">Once enemy creatures are in the encounter area, roll initiative. On the trap’s initiative count, a random elemental tile explodes with primordial energy, making the following attack.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Initiative: </b>+2</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Varies</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Each creature in burst</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+19 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d10 + 7 damage of a type determined by a d6 roll (1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; 6, thunder damage), and the target is slowed (save ends). The burst creates a zone of difficult terrain until the end of the trap’s next turn. The type of energy also determines the current vulnerabilities of the chaos stone (see Countermeasures).</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Succeeding on a complexity 1 skill challenge (4 successes before 3 failures) using either Thievery or Arcana disables the trap. The characters disabling the elemental tiles must be adjacent to the chaos stone to make an attempt. Each attempt takes a standard action. On a failed check, all the tiles explode in the close burst attack.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chaos stone has AC 14, Reflex 14, Fortitude 28, and hp 100. When it is reduced to 0 hit points, the trap is destroyed. When the elemental tiles trap makes a close burst attack, its chaos stone focus is especially susceptible to the same kind of attack until the start of the trap’s next turn. During that time, a successful attack against the chaos stone that deals the same type of damage as the trap’s most recent attack automatically scores a critical hit on the chaos stone.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 71.</p>
