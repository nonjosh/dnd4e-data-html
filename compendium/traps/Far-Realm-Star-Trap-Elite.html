Motes that resemble starlight bob up and down in six places throughout the area.</i></p><span class="traplead"><b>Trap:</b> When a creature enters a square that has a mote of starlight, that light attaches itself to the creature and begins to burn. Each round, another mote is drawn to the afflicted creature; when all six motes are on the creature, the motes explode.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Perception check is needed to notice the motes, unless they are hidden.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 26: The character identifies the nature of the starlight motes, and realizes that if all six latch on to the same creature, they’ll explode.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">When a creature enters a square with a mote in it or starts its turn there, the mote makes the following attack. If the attack is successful, the starlight mote latches on. At the start of a creature’s turn, if it has at least one mote upon it, the nearest mote moves to enter the creature’s space and makes the same attack, attempting to latch on to that creature.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack * Radiant</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Opportunity Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> 1<br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>One creature</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+31 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>1d8 + 9 radiant damage, and the mote latches on to the target. While a mote is latched on to a creature, that creature is dazed, and at the start of its turn it takes 1d8 + 9 radiant damage. The mote is removed when it is destroyed (see Countermeasures) or when the target or a creature adjacent to the target succeeds on a DC 20 Athletics check to pull the mote off the target. A mote that is pulled off occupies the target’s square, but for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds 20, the creature removing the mote can push the mote 1 square.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Secondary Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">When all six star motes latch on to the same creature, they make the following attack.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Opportunity Action </b>Close blast 5</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Target: </b>Each creature in blast</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Attack: </b>+31 vs. Reflex</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hit: </b>4d8 + 10 radiant damage, and the target is knocked prone.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss: </b>Half damage.</span><span class="trapblockbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Effect: </b>All the motes are destroyed.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The starlight motes are bound to a particular location, and while that location can be somewhat large, the motes do not pass its boundaries. If a creature with attached motes leaves the area, the motes unlatch at the boundary.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arcana DC 31:  A check made as a standard action by a creature sharing the same space with a mote or adjacent to one can calm it for a short time. With a success, the mote unlatches from a creature (if it is attached) and does not move or attack until the end of the next turn of the creature that succeeded on the check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each mote has AC 33, Reflex 33, Fortitude 30, hp 75, and immune radiant. While attached to a creature, a mote gains a +5 bonus to AC and Reflex.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242060000" target="_new">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</a>, page(s) 74.</p>
