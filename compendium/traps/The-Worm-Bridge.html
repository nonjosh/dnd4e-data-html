A creature can freely enter or exit the area, but it does so at its own peril.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Perception</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 18: The character spots movement in the purple worm and realizes it is undead.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Arcana</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC 21: The character recognizes the danger of the Worm Bridge, knows its effect, and understands its countermeasures.</span><span class="traplead"><b>Initiative</b> +5</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Trigger</span><span class="trapblockbody">The worm bridge attacks any creature not given permission to cross it by Bragarra.

A creature pushed behind the head is moved into its body, a 2-square-wide tunnel of dead flesh. Creatures in the body lack line of sight and line of effect to creatures outside the body.

On a success, the character can either keep the mouth open or closed. Either way, the Worm Bridge cannot attack until the end of the character’s next turn.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can attack the Worm Bridge’s head (AC 24, other defenses 22; hp 220; resist 10 necrotic, resist 5 all).
