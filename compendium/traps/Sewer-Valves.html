The second time the die roll indicates that valve should open, it bursts open with greater force, gaining a +2 bonus to its attack roll.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a minor action, a character can make a Perception check (DC 15 + one-half level) or a Dungeoneering check (DC 10 + one-half level) to predict which valve will open on the hazard’s next turn.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/239647200" target="_new">Eberron Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 282.</p>
