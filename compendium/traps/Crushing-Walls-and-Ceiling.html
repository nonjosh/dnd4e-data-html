Each section is triggered when a creature enters the area while standing on the floor.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Special</span><span class="trapblockbody">The southern section has crushing walls, the central section has a crushing ceiling, and the eastern section has crushing walls. The walls move inward every other turn, while the ceiling moves downward every turn. The walls meet each other and the ceiling meets the floor in the eighth round, assuming no countermeasures are taken.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Attack</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> <br/></span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Target: </b>Creatures in the area of each section of the trap. Once triggered, the walls in the southern and eastern sections move inward 1 square every other turn. Once triggered, the ceiling in the central area moves down 1 square every turn. Creatures adjacent to a wall are pushed 1 square. When the crushing walls come together, or when the ceiling meets the floor, all creatures in the area are slowed and are subject to an attack.<br/>The walls and floor stay in this position for 3 rounds, then move back at 1 square per round and reset.</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Attack: </b>+15 vs. Fortitude</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Hit: </b>3d6 + 6 damage, and the target is immobilized (save ends).</span><span class="trapblockbody"><b>Miss: </b>Half damage.</span><span class="trapblocktitle">Countermeasures</span><span class="trapblockbody"><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 16:  A character adjacent to a wall can delay the trigger 1 round with a successful check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thievery DC 21:  A character adjacent to a moving wall can delay its movement for 1 round with a successful check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strength DC 16:  A character adjacent to a moving wall or who is tall enough to reach the moving ceiling can prevent the wall or ceilingâ€™s movement with a successful check (+5 to DC if the walls are 1 square apart). All characters in the area can aid the character making this check.<br/><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception DC 21:  The floors are riddled with niches under secret sliding trapdoors. Opening a trapdoor is a minor action, while slipping into it is a move action. The floor contains one niche per square. Each niche can be occupied by one creature.<br/>A PC in a niche can ride out the crushing walls and ceiling. However, upon leaving a niche and stepping onto the floor again, the section of the trap the PC stands in is triggered once more.<br/></span><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/163" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 163</a>, page(s) 43.</p>
