		<h1 class="player">Wizard's Escape</h1><i>The guard looked on with horror as the prisoner squeezed between the bars of his cell, his face and chest distorting in a fashion that should kill—or at least disfigure—him, then returning to normal.</i><br/><p><span class="ritualstats"><b>Component Cost</b>: 150 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 520 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</span><b>Level</b>: 6<br/><b>Category</b>: Exploration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 10 minutes</p><p>For the ritual’s duration, you and up to eight allies can squeeze into and through spaces that a Tiny creature can squeeze through, allowing them to fit into crevices, under some doors, and through most barred gates or walls. An affected creature must still squeeze to fit into a space it could not normally enter. How this ritual manifests varies from caster to caster: It can allow creatures to squeeze their body as though boneless, to step through half-dimensions, ripple into and out of smaller shapes, or anything else.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/366" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 366</a>, page(s) 33.</p>
