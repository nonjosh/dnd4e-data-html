This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier) does not trigger the alarm.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm. When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them. When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you of the intrusion and awakens you from sleep. In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: While holding a tiny bell (5 gp), you use a fine silver wire (5 gp) to scribe runes on the warded areaâ€™s perimeter.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/405" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 405</a>.</p>
