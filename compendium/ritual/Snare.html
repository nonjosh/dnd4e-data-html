		<h1 class="player">Snare</h1><i>A barely visible circle appears on the ground, ready to entrap any enemies that enter the area.</i><br/><p><span class="ritualstats"><b>Component Cost</b>: 25 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 150 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Nature</span><b>Level</b>: 4<br/><b>Category</b>: Warding<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 8 hours or until discharged</p><p>You create a magical snare in a 2-square-by-2-square area adjacent to you. When you complete the ritual, make a Nature check. The check result is the Perception DC to detect the snare and the Thievery DC to disable it. As part of the ritual, you can name creatures that can pass freely through the snare’s area, and you can set conditions that allow a creature to bypass the snare. Any other creature that enters the snare’s area is subject to an attack equal to your level + 4 vs. Reflex. On a hit, the target is immobilized (save ends). When the snare is triggered, you become aware that it has been triggered regardless of your distance from it. The ritual is also discharged.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950164" target="_new">Player's Handbook 2</a>, page(s) 216.</p>
