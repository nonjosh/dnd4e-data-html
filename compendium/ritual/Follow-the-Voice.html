At the end of the duration, you reappear outside the sending stone attuned to your sending stone. If your stone has multiple attuned stones, you appear outside the one used to speak to your stone before you began the ritual.<br/><br/>Once the ritual’s duration ends, the sending stones cannot serve as the focus for this ritual again for 24 hours, and you cannot cast it again for 24 hours.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 28.</p>
