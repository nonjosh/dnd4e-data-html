This ritual affects only nonmagical inanimate objects such as gear, armor, weapons, food, and corpses. A single performance destroys a 5-foot cube of materials of a type based on the Arcana check result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpreserved Organic Materials: This category includes any foodstuffs, liquids, uncured leather, plant materials, carcasses, and so on. A successful ritual results in transforming this substance into foul-smelling slime.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preserved Organic Materials: These items include cured leather, specially preserved foodstuffs, wooden weapons, and specially treated plant or animal based objects. An item affected dissolves into a disgusting paste.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metals: This category includes iron doors and bars, weapons, metal jewelry, cutlery, and metallic finished items. Such objects rust or corrode, becoming brittle or turning to dust.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals: Minerals include gemstones such as rubies, diamonds, and similar precious stones, as well as all metal ore. Time Ravager reduces these items to dust.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Type</th></tr><tr><td>19 or lower</td><td>Unpreserved organic materials</td></tr><tr><td>20-29</td><td>As 19 or lower, plus preserved organic materials</td></tr><tr><td>30-39</td><td>As 20-29, plus metals</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>As 30-39, plus minerals</td></tr></table></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218587200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 146.</p>
