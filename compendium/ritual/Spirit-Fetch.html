		<h1 class="player">Spirit Fetch</h1><i>You call forth an insubstantial spirit—fey, primal, or shadow—to unpleasantly influence another to do your bidding.</i><br/><p><span class="ritualstats"><b>Component Cost</b>: 20 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 50 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana, Religion</span><b>Level</b>: 2<br/><b>Category</b>: Exploration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Special</p><p>When complete, this ritual calls forth a spiritual presence, or “fetch,” of a shape you define. Typically, these fetches are small, indistinct, and shaped like a small animal or person. You can send this spirit to a creature (or creatures) whose specific appearance you can visualize or whose name you can provide, or to whom you have a material connection such as a vial of blood. You whisper a simple command of 10 words of less, such as “Come to me,” “Bring me the ritual components,” or “Burn down the fortress wall.”<br/>The fetch then goes to find the creature you designated at a rapid pace (speed 15) and seeks out the creature you specify. It cannot communicate, but the recipient senses its presence and receives your command. Unless the recipient does as you wish, the fetch remains at the target’s side as a constant reminder. The fetch cannot be harmed, but dispel magic used successfully can drive it away for a day.<br/>Your skill check result determines how long the fetch exists.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Check Result</th><th>Duration</th></tr><tr><td>19 or lower</td><td>12 hours</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>1 day</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>1 week</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>1 month</td></tr></table></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/380" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 380</a>, page(s) 90.</p>
