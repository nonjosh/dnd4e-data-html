The ritual uses materials found in the area, so the lodge can be formed of snow, stone, wood, or even sod. The lodge encloses a close burst 4 in size. The interior is dry and clean and includes nine bunks, a long table with stools, and a writing desk.<br/>The shelter is not heated or cooled, but it is immune to fire and impervious to all damage. Access to its interior is by two shuttered windows, a single door, and a chimney. Furniture can be removed from the shelter, but it vanishes along with the lodge when the ritualâ€™s duration expires.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 118.</p>
