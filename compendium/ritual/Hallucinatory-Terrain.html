Artificial structures, equipment, and creatures cannot be changed. A meadow might look like a hill, a pond could look like a meadow, and so on; but a road or a tower in the area remains the same.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature can discern the illusion if it succeeds on an Arcana check or a Perception check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier). This check is a minor action if the creature has not interacted with the illusion, but can be made as a free action the first time the creature interacts with the illusion. If you conceal an area of hindering terrain, a creature is still entitled to a saving throw if forced into that terrain.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/405" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 405</a>.</p>
