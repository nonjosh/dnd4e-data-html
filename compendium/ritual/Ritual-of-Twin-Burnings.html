		<h1 class="player">Ritual of Twin Burnings</h1><i>Striking with the sacrificial knife, you intone words of dark terror. The victim is utterly consumed, and a crystal pane inscribed with a jagged rune appears.</i><br/><p><span class="ritualstats"><b>Component Cost</b>: 50,000 gp, plus special<br/><b>Market Price</b>: -<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</span><b>Level</b>: 26<br/><b>Category</b>: Binding<br/><b>Time</b>: 2 hours<br/><b>Duration</b>: Permanent</p><p>This complicated and deeply evil ritual must be performed a total of nine times to subjugate the will of a creature held in Thakorsil’s Seat. Each performance has the following requirements.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be performed during a full moon within 20 feet of Thakorsil’s Seat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature of at least paragon tier. That creature dies at the last second<br/>of the performance, when its body and spirit are utterly destroyed—hence “twin burnings.”<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the performance is successful, it creates a triangular crystalline pane etched with a rune of chaos. The pane<br/>appears near the Seat. Any damage destroys a pane, but only missing panes must be replaced in further performance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individual performance is interrupted, it fails. Panes already created remain, though, and the overarching<br/>ritual can continue from that point.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nine performances are successfully completed, a nine-sided crystal pyramid encloses Thakorsil’s Seat. The<br/>occupant of the artifact can then physically leave the Seat but is permanently and totally enslaved to the one who<br/>completed the ritual.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218287200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide</a>, page(s) 59.</p>
