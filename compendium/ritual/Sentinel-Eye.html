		<h1 class="player">Sentinel Eye</h1><i>You conjure forth a phantasmal sentry—a slender pillar 6 feet tall, topped with a strange, floating, unblinking eye. The eye watches over your camp, alerting you to the presence of intruders and offering you the ability to spy on them in turn.</i><br/><p><span class="ritualstats"><b>Component Cost</b>: 800 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 4,200 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</span><b>Level</b>: 14<br/><b>Category</b>: Warding<br/><b>Time</b>: 30 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 24 hours (special)</p><p>This ritual creates watchful eyes that you place in any square within 10 squares of where you perform the ritual.Your Arcana check result determines how many eyes you can place and what type of vision or sensory ability they possess.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchful eyes function like those of the Eye of Alarm ritual, except as follows. When the eyes detect an intruder, they sound no audible alarm, but instead alert you through a telepathic link. This link functions regardless of distance, though you must remain on the same plane.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchful eye also creates a mild connection between you and the creature that triggered it. “The creature that triggered the Sentinel Eye ritual’s watchful eye” is sufficient identification for the Observe Creature ritual, if you wish to spy on it at a later date using that ritual. You can use the View Location ritual to spy on the location where a triggered creature was when the eye was triggered, if you have that ritual, since you obviously know the area in which you performed Sentinel Eye. (However, that use has limited utility given the 1 hour performance time of View Location.)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, worth 2,000 gp. The Sentinel Eye lasts as long as the focus remains within 20 squares of any of the watchful eyes. You can hide or protect the ritual’s focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Eyes Created</th><th>Vision or Ability</th></tr><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>1</td><td>Normal</td></tr><tr><td>10–19</td><td>2</td><td>Normal</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>3</td><td>Darkvision</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>4</td><td>Darkvision</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>5</td><td>Darkvision, tremorsense 12</td></tr></table></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217887200" target="_new">Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons</a>, page(s) 85.</p>
