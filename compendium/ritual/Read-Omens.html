This ritual can see only about half an hour into the future, and it deals only with the immediate effects of taking a specific action. The ritual cannot deduce long-term consequences or predict the outcome of long-term actions.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you ask the question, the DM secretly rolls an Arcana check or Religion check (whichever provides the higher modifier) for you against a moderate DC. Your allies cannot aid you in making this check. If you try again to predict the outcome of the same action, the ritual supplies the same check result. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful Check: The DM tells you that the intended action should bring one of these results.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weal—a good result, such as when the reward outweighs the risk.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe—a bad result, such as when the risk outweighs the reward.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weal and Woe—both good and bad, such as when the reward is equal to the risk.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing—neither a good nor a bad result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed Check: As per “nothing” above. You can’t tell if this “nothing” is due to a successful check or a failed check.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: You drop a set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens (worth 50 gp) to read the answer to your query in their arrangement.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/405" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 405</a>.</p>
