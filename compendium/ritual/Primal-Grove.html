You use this ritual either to create a grove and an entrance to it or to create an entrance to a grove that you or someone else created.<br/><br/>Creating a Grove: When you create a grove, it appears in a hidden location in the world or the Feywild, and you determine its password. You also create an entrance to it (see “Creating an Entrance” below).<br/><br/>A grove generates enough food and drink to sustain its occupants and has a moderate, unchanging climate. If you move objects into a grove, they remain there when you leave, but food and other resources created by the grove disappear when removed.<br/><br/>Your Nature check determines the grove’s size in squares and how many creatures it can accommodate.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Nature Check Result</th><th>Size</th><th>Capacity</th></tr><tr><td>24 or lower</td><td>5 × 5</td><td>25 Medium creatures</td></tr><tr><td>25–34</td><td>7 × 7</td><td>50 Medium creatures</td></tr><tr><td>35–44</td><td>10 × 10</td><td>100 Medium creatures</td></tr><tr><td>45 or higher</td><td>14 × 14</td><td>200 Medium creatures</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Creating an Entrance: A primal grove is inaccessible, except to those who know its password and pass through an entrance to it. You use this ritual to create an entrance to a primal grove, the password of which you must know.<br/><br/>When you create an entrance to a grove, the entrance appears in a square adjacent to you. If a creature that knows the grove’s password enters that square, the creature can teleport to a square in the grove. Anyone inside the grove can exit it as part of a move action, teleporting either to an active entrance or to the most recent entrance if none are active.<br/><br/>Your Nature check determines the duration of the entrance. When you create a grove, you use a single check to create both the grove and an entrance to it. As a minor action, you can close an entrance you created.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Nature Check Result</th><th>Entrance Duration</th></tr><tr><td>24 or lower</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>25–34</td><td>24 hours</td></tr><tr><td>35–44</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>45 or higher</td><td>1 year</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Extraordinary magic might allow someone to enter a grove against the creator’s will.</p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 157.</p>
