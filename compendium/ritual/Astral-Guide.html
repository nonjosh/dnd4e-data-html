You summon a fragment of divine essence to guide you. The guide sheds bright light on 8 squares in all directions, and it lacks physical form and cannot be harmed in any way.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this ritual, you name a specific, fixed destination in the Astral Sea. The most common use of this ritual is to lead its user to a particular astral dominion. However, the astral guide could also lead you to the exit of a labyrinth, the entrance to a dungeon, or to a site within an astral dominion. The guide cannot lead you to a general location, such as “a room with astral diamonds” or to an unknown place, like “the death knight Malachi’s hiding place.” If the named location does exist within the Astral Sea, the guide leads you there by the shortest (though not always the safest) route.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide hovers in the air and moves at your speed. It remains within 12 squares of you. The guide remains until you reach your destination, the ritual’s duration expires, or you take an extended rest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the ritual, make a Religion check. The result determines the duration for which astral guide remains.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Religion Check Result</th><th>Duration</th></tr><tr><td>19 or lower</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>4 hours</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>16 hours</td></tr></table></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218937200" target="_new">Manual of the Planes</a>, page(s) 148.</p>
