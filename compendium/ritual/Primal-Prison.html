The subject must be helpless or willing, and the object you imprison it inside must be larger than it. Your Nature check determines the maximum level of the subject.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Nature Check Result</th><th>Maximum Level</th></tr><tr><td>14 or lower</td><td>Your level - 5</td></tr><tr><td>15–24</td><td>Your level</td></tr><tr><td>25 or higher</td><td>Your level + 2</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The subject remains imprisoned until you choose to discharge the ritual or until you die. In addition, you must take a personal effect from the subject and hide it or carry it with you. If the personal effect is brought to the subject’s location, the subject can be released.<br/><br/>You choose whether the subject ages while imprisoned, and the subject is unaware of its surroundings. Destroying the imprisoning object releases the subject, who appears in the object’s space, bloodied and asleep, if the creature is capable of sleep. You know if the object is destroyed, regardless of your distance from it.<br/><br/>The imprisoning object you takes on a faint resemblance to the subject. Knots in the shape of the subject’s face might form on a tree, or a stone might take on coloration faintly depicting the subject’s silhouette.</p><br/>Update (4/13/2010)<br/>In the second sentence of the third paragraph, replace “unconscious” with “asleep, if the creature is capable of sleep.” <br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786950232" target="_new">Primal Power</a>, page(s) 158.</p>
