As such, paladins are its most fervent worshipers, but crusaders from all walks of life look to the Flame for guidance. The Silver Flame is an abstraction, not a deity. It represents powerful forces of good and self-sacrifice that keep evil locked away.

The Church has a definite chain of command, and its members aren’t afraid to wield their power in secularaffairs. Flamekeep, in Thrane, is the Church’s capital and home to its leader, the Keeper of the Flame. The teachings of the Silver Flame (and its church) are:<br/>- Destroy evil in all its forms. Undead are particularly abhorrent to the Silver Flame.<br/>- Bring relief to those who suffer.<br/>- Protect those who cannot protect themselves.Offer aid to those who can.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 18.</p>
