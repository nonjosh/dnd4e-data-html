		<h1 class="player">The Raven Queen</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Type: </b>God<br/><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br/><b>Gender:</b> Female<br/><b>Domain: </b>Death, Fate, Winter<br/></p>The name of the god of death is long forgotten, but she is called the Raven Queen. She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to:<br/>* Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.<br/>* Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.<br/>* Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queenâ€™s throne.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 22, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247520000" target="_new">Heroes of the Fallen Lands</a>, page(s) 53.</p>
