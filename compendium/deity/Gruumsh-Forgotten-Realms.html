		<h1 class="player">Gruumsh (Forgotten Realms)</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br/><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br/><b>Gender:</b> Male<br/><b>Sphere:</b> Savagery<br/><b>Dominion:</b> Nishrek<br/><b>Priests:</b> Shamans<br/><b>Adjective:</b> Gruuman<br/><b>Domain: </b>Destruction, Storm, Strength<br/></p>Gruumsh’s influence has flourished in recent decades with the growth of the orc population, and as other humanoids have come under his sway.  Hisrecent triumphs include putting the orc pantheon and other minor deities of the savage races under his thumb.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Gruumans maintain that their god was born with one eye, the eladrin assert that he lost an eye in combat with Corellon. The two divine powers have fought countless times, and they remain the bitterest of enemies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gruumsh is a god of conquest, driving his savage multitudes to expand their power by whatever brutal means they wish. His shamans advise chiefs and warmongers to raid, kill, and conquer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last day of Marpenoth, which Gruumans call Gharfek’taaz (“Feast of the Bloodied Stones”), commemorates Gruumsh’s ascendancy as the master of Nishrek. On this day, new shamans are ordained in a bloody orgy of torture and sacrifice.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218287200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide</a>, page(s) 74.</p>
