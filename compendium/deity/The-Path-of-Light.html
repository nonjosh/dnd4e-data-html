Its adherents don’t worship a deity, but instead recognize a universal force of positive energy they call il-Yannah, “the Great Light.” Followers of the Path of Light strive for physical and mental perfection through meditation and communion with this Great Light. Such perfection is necessary, for followers of the Path of Light expect to do battle with evil forces—especially the sinister Dreaming Dark.<br/><br/>The central teachings of the Path of Light are:<br/>- Seek excellence in both mind and body, for a great war against the dark is brewing.<br/>- Do not look to deities for divinity. Divinity is within the grasp of mortals if they but touch the Great Light.<br/>- Use your honed skills to discover and vanquish evil beings.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 18.</p>
