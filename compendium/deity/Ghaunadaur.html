Not long after the Spider Queen transformed into a greater god, she arranged for Ghaunadaur’s drow followers to forget him.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Which Lurks, having watched the rest of the drow deities die in their struggle against Lolth, knew enough to slink away into the darkest corner of the cosmos he could find. In the Dismal Caverns, Ghaunadaur’s power grew. He has come to rule the lowest forms of sentience: the oozes, slimes, and abominations.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghaunadaur revels in the suffering of all forms of life, and in the feel of flesh consumed by acid. He is revered by incredibly ancient creatures, including the terrifying abominations of the Abolethic Sovereignty. His priests are unbound by holy days or scripture, compelled only to destroy and consume in the name of their hateful master.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218287200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide</a>, page(s) 74.</p>
