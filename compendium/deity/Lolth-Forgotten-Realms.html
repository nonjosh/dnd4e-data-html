		<h1 class="player">Lolth (Forgotten Realms)</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Type: </b>Greater God<br/><b>Alignment: </b>Chaotic Evil<br/><b>Gender:</b> Female<br/><b>Sphere:</b> Drow<br/><b>Dominion:</b> Demonweb Pits<br/><b>Priests:</b> Arachne<br/><b>Adjective:</b> Lolthite<br/><b>Domain: </b>Darkness, Poison, Strife<br/></p>The Spider Queen sits alone in the Demonweb Pits, presiding over the drow and their manifold schemes and betrayals. She revels in blood, hungers for sacrifice, and toys with worshipers and victims alike. Hers is a cold cruelty born of the blackest pits in the endless Abyss.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lolth exists on her home plane in the form of seven monstrous spiders and one beautiful drow maiden. She took these forms when, through the force of her own horrific will, she transformed into the greater goddess she is today.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lolth appears to her worshipers from time to time, but never because she is summoned. Lolth serves no one, and she demands absolute fealty from all drow, though only females can serve her as arachne. Males are considered unclean, if occasionally necessary. Still, if one turns his back on her, she takes vengeful notice.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/218287200" target="_new">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide</a>, page(s) 75.</p>
