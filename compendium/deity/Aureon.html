		<h1 class="player">Aureon</h1><p class="flavor"><b>Type: </b>God<br/><b>Alignment: </b>Unaligned<br/><b>Gender:</b> Male<br/><b>Sphere:</b> Knowledge, law, arcane lore and magic<br/><b>Domain: </b>Arcana, Justice, Knowledge<br/></p>Aureon is the god of knowledge, arcane lore, and magic. He also values order and law. He is Onatar’s brother and Boldrei’s husband, and bears a mysterious connection to the Shadow. Most arcane spellcasters call him their patron, as do sages, librarians, scribes, professors, and students. In religious texts, he appears as a human or gnome wizard, and, on rare occasion, as a grand blue dragon.<br/>He urges his followers to:<br/>- Respect and acquire knowledge, especially knowledge that was once lost. Knowledge is the most powerful force on Eberron.<br/>- Value reason and sound thought over emotion and rash action.<br/>- Educate yourself, your children, and your allies.<br/><br/>Aureon is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of  civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The  Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.<br/><br/>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:<br/>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.<br/>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven’t harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.<br/>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.<p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 15.</p>
