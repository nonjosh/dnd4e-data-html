		<h1 class="player">Courtier</h1><p><i></i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>You must be trained in Diplomacy. The games of court are about winning allies and subtle persuasion, which is impossible without at least some knowledge of the art of diplomacy.<br/><br/>Most adventurers stick out like a troll among halflings when placed in courtly situations. They see only a bunch of nobles and retainers fawning over one another in incomprehensible ways with little relevance to their lives.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courtier knows better. A battle rages amid the smiles and niceties of court. Each word is a carefully calculated move, each meeting a play for political power, and each friend another piece in the game of court. A single mistake can mean the difference between acquiring a powerful position and being clapped in irons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courtier sees unique solutions to a problem. When confronted by a wicked duke, a typical adventurer might launch an assault on his keep or try to assassinate him. A courtier might instead go to the king and plant the idea that the duke’s wicked acts are a political liability. The villainous duke could soon be stripped of his lands and titles, thus ending his threat just as effectively.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Courtier Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Whenever you make a Diplomacy check, you can roll twice and take the higher result.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Courtier Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: Whenever you would make a Bluff check, you can make a Diplomacy check instead.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Courtier Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever you would make a Streetwise check to gather information in a settlement, you can make a Diplomacy check instead.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Courtier Utility 2</span>Courtier's Cover</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You quickly cover for another’s gaffe.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: While you are able to speak, an ally that you can hear and is within 5 squares of you makes a  Diplomacy check and dislikes the result.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Make a Diplomacy check and use your result in place of the triggering result.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Courtier Utility 6</span>Call for Capitulation</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your words reveal the wisdom of surrender.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Free Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You would make an Intimidate check to force an opponent to surrender</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: In place of the Intimidate check, make a Diplomacy check with a DC equal to the target’s Will defense + 5.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Courtier Utility 10</span>Bastion of Words</h1><p class="flavor"><i>A well-timed warning causes your enemies to hesitate.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close burst</b> 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: Each enemy who can hear and understand you in the burst.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Make a Diplomacy check against each target’s passive Insight.
