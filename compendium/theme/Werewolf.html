		<h1 class="player">Werewolf</h1><p><i>&quot;The beast within me strains to escape my control, and when it does, you must run. Run as fast as you can, but I’ll warn you that even that might not be enough.&quot;</i></p>When people think of lycanthropy, they think of werewolves. No other lycanthrope evokes the same fear, even if other lycanthropes might be stronger and more dangerous. Life on the frontiers puts settlers in contact with wolves and, having watched livestock vanish and having fended off attacks against ravenous wolves, the fears seem justified, even though most wolves avoid mankind when they can.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although ordinary wolves are content to go their own way, ranging across the countryside in packs, werewolves hunt humans. They and the wolves they enslave are aggressive, vicious, and unrelenting in their attacks. Werewolf packs are dangerous, since they can scout out the landscape by day in human form and launch attacks by night. They might be fearless in battle, but they avoid the cities where they face discovery and death. Instead, they keep to the wilderness, where their attacks might go unnoticed and where retribution comes slowly—if at all.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all lycanthropes, being a werewolf is no guarantee of evil. The hunger remains, but a strong will can control it. It is always a struggle, though. A werewolf must always fight to keep the beast in check, and sometimes even the best efforts are not enough. Werewolves seeking redemption for or escape from their natures favor the adventurer’s life since it carries them away from innocents and lets them vent their fury on more deserving foes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all werewolves inherited their natures from their parents, passing on what many would consider to be a curse. Such werewolves are human or have human blood, such as half-elves or half-orcs. Just about any other natural or fey race could become a werewolf by succumbing to moon frenzy or fall prey to a curse due to their bloodlust.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Werewolf Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Intimidate checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the shapechanger subtype. As such, you are subject to effects that affect shapechangers. In addition, any enemy has combat advantage against you when attacking you with a silvered weapon or implement. Also, you are immune to moon frenzy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, you gain the wolf shape power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Werewolf Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When interacting with wolves and similar creatures, you gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, while wolf shape is active, you gain a +2 power bonus to speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Werewolf Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: When you use the wolf shape power, you can assume the form of a humanoid-wolf hybrid, instead of a wolf. While in hybrid form, your equipment does not become part of your new form, and you are not forced to drop any items you are holding. You are also not limited to using implement and weapon attack powers that have the beast form keyword.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Werewolf Utility </span>Wolf Shape</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Loosing the beast within triggers a sudden, painful transformation into a menacing wolf.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Polymorph</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You change from your humanoid form to a beast form—a wolf—that lasts until the end of the encounter. Alternatively, you can end the form as a minor action and shift 1 square. While you are in beast form, you can’t use weapon or implement attack powers that lack the beast form keyword, although you can sustain such powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in this form, you have low-light vision. The form is your size, and it doesn’t otherwise change your game statistics or movement modes. Your equipment becomes part of the form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear, except a shield.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of the form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your form is inaccessible.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the form ends, you can use the secondary power at will.</p><br/><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level"></span>Wolf Shape Secondary Power</h1><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b> <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Beast Form</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melee</b> touch</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One creature</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Attack</b>: Highest ability modifier + 3 vs. AC<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 11: Highest ability modifier + 6<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: Highest ability modifier + 9</p><p class="flavor"><b>Hit</b>: 1d10 + highest ability modifier damage.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 21: 2d10 + highest ability modifier damage.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: You can use this power in place of a melee basic attack.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Werewolf Utility 2</span>Wolf's Vitality</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Anger courses through your veins and lends a fierce strength to your legs.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Beast Form</b>, <b>Healing</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: You must have started this turn bloodied.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Until the end of the encounter, your speed increases by 1 while you are in beast form.
