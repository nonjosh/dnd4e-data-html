		<h1 class="player">Sidhe Lord</h1><p><i>&quot;The archfey might seem the most powerful, but the real masters of the people are the Sidhe lords such as I.&quot;</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-elf, or any race that has the fey origin.<br/><br/>Among the fey races, particularly elves and eladrin, powerful noble houses have arisen over the years as the authority in the Feywild. The various fey courts, including the Summer Queen’s Court of Stars, are made up of representatives from these houses. Although the houses vary in makeup, goals, and methods, their members are collectively known as Sidhe lords—a title that paints them all with the same brush.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first true Sidhe lords were elves who lived before the great conflict that splintered the race into three factions. In the days when the race was in its youth, some ambitious elves claimed dominion over the untamed Feywild. When none could challenge them, these early Sidhe lords established themselves as pillars of power in the realm, and an order was born among the fey races. The common people showed deference to the Sidhe lords, and the lords protected those within their dominion.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, as the people of the Feywild matured and the elf race split into elves, eladrin, and drow, a greater variety of Sidhe lords rose to prominence. Most of these were individuals of other races, such as drow and satyrs, who had gained influence and forged alliances. Rather than engaging in power struggles that could weaken their houses, the established lords acknowledged the new self-proclaimed nobles, giving them legitimacy. To this day, most of the Sidhe lords of the Feywild are eladrin (many of the elf lords took their power bases with them into the natural world), but the newer noble houses have offspring of other races.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble houses of the Sidhe lords behave much as their counterparts do in the mortal world; they work together, come into conflict with one another, plot and manipulate, and meddle in the affairs of common people. The fey houses typically choose colors and heraldry the same way that human nobles do, but their symbols are fey creatures such as displacer beasts and owlbears.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Sidhe lords are eager to associate themselves with dominion over an aspect of the Feywild. The Prince of Frost, for example, claims sovereignty over the Vale of Long Night, and he is known as the Sidhe lord who commands winter (at least, within the Feywild). Other Sidhe lords might hold sway over specific kinds of fey creatures (for example, displacer beasts).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formidable fey nobles make bargains with weaker beings or with those they favor. Sidhe lords have amassed a great deal of influence and arcane might, and a formal pact establishes a bond that allows a lord to transfer that power to a recipient. Many warlocks have such pacts, but Sidhe lords are free to enter into them with all kinds of creatures. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a Sidhe lord, a representative of a noble house of the Feywild. Whether you are a youth or someone just coming up through the ranks of your house, your station affords you certain privileges. Moreover, you have the power and authority to make pacts, bargains, and accords as a Sidhe lord, and you can use your status to your advantage.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sidhe Lord Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the summon Sidhe ally power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sidhe Lord Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: When you are in a city or other civilized area that recognizes your house’s prestige, you can receive a week’s lodging in comfortable if not lavish quarters at no charge. The quarters include room for up to eight of your allies, as well as meals each day. You have the use of up to three servants, who perform common tasks for the duration of your stay.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sidhe Lord Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: Whenever your Sidhe house guard uses its teleportation power while you are adjacent to it, you can teleport up to 6 squares to a space adjacent to the guard’s destination.<br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Sidhe Lord Utility </span>Summon Sidhe Ally</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You summon an ally of your noble house, bound to obey you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Summoning</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You summon a Sidhe house guard in an unoccupied space within range. The guard is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the guard’s description. You must have line of effect to the guard to command it. When you command the guard, you and the guard share knowledge but not senses. If you use a move action to move yourself, you can also command the guard to move up to its speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guard makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard lasts until it drops below 1 hit point, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, the guard lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until you use this power again.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Sidhe Lord Utility 2</span>Sidhe Bargain</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You offer a bargain to one of your allies: a little more speed now in exchange for some of the ally’s extra effort later.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Standard Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 10</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One ally</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The target can lose an action point to immediately take a standard action as a free action. If the target does so, you gain an action point.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Sidhe Lord Utility 6</span>Unified Front</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You move to a better position from which to fight, and you and your guard present a dangerous front to your enemies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Move Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You and your Sidhe house guard can both move up to your respective speeds + 2. If you end this movement adjacent to your guard, you and it both gain temporary hit points equal to your healing surge value.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Sidhe Lord Utility 10</span>Temporary Fey Pact</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You forge a pact similar to those of warlocks, giving some power to an ally and drawing on that ally’s vitality in return.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Target</b>: One ally</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You enter into a pact with the target that lasts until you take a minor action to end it or until you use this power again. Once per encounter, while this pact is active, the target can take a minor action to cause you to lose the use of one encounter power or daily power of your choice that has a level. When the target does so, he or she regains the use of one of his or her expended powers of the same usage, type, and level. For example, if you lost the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power, the target could regain the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power. In addition, you can spend the target’s healing surges as if they were your own, if the target allows it. </p><br/></p><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 108.</p>
