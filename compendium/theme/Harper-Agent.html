		<h1 class="player">Harper Agent</h1><p><i>You fight for your freedom? Well, I fight for the freedom of all.</i></p>Bards who chronicle the past age sing of the Harpers, a secret society dedicated to advancing the cause of good across Faerûn. In the group’s glory days, its members included figures of legend such as Storm Silverhand, whose beautiful voice matched her ferocity in battle, and Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elf wielder of powerful and ancient elven magic. The Harpers passed from existence in the wake of the Spellplague, but the organization was reborn sixty years ago and is now based out of the city of Everlund, several hundred miles northeast of Neverwinter. Its stated purpose is to stop the encroachment of the expanding empire of Netheril.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You grew up hearing tales of the Harpers’ exploits and have long sought to do your part to stem the tide of darkness. You’ve always had a facility for deception and intrigue, coupled with a strong sense of right and wrong. As you grew older, you searched for the best way to put those skills to good use. You journeyed to Everlund to enlist in the group, whereupon you were given a task to complete in order to earn your Harper pin.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were dispatched to Neverwinter, there to contact a local Harper agent named Cymril and lend your services to the Sons of Alagondar. Cymril, in addition to being one of the few Harpers in the city, is the leader of the Sons of Alagondar. This underground resistance movement opposes the imperialistic aims of Dagult Neverember, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, who has established himself as the “Protector” of Neverwinter during its reconstruction. The Harpers believe that Neverember’s intentions are less than noble, and that he seeks to expand his mercantile empire for his own gain at the expense of the people. They are sure that, with his ruthless methods and suspect alliances, Neverember plans to usurp the throne of Neverwinter and build a cutthroat empire on the Sword Coast.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your arrival, you learned the hard way that Neverember’s treachery runs deeper than even the Harpers know. You were included among a band of rebels on a nighttime reconnaissance mission led by Cymril. All of a sudden, your world turned inside out when a squad of Neverember’s mercenaries ambushed your group. You avoided the initial assault by ducking into an alcove—where you watched as Cymril began cutting down your comrades! Clearly, she was working in league with the soldiers. One of Cymril’s lieutenants turned on her and wounded her fatally just before he himself was cut down by the mercenaries.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mercenaries moved on, they left the bodies of their victims (including Cymril) in the street as a warning to other dissidents. Before you left the area, you had the foresight to pluck Cymril’s Harper pin from her vest, lest it fall into the wrong hands.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Cymril truly a traitor to Neverwinter’s cause, or was she working as a double agent? You can’t be sure. What you do know is that when both the Sons of Alagondar and the Harpers got wind of what had happened, they immediately suspected that someone in the ambushed group was working for the other side.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the newcomer, you bear the brunt of the suspicion of both groups. The city’s rebel forces have fractured since Cymril’s death into disorganized and ineffective war bands. Discovering which of the few Harper associates in Neverwinter you can trust is important to you. However, if you have to work alone to get the job done, that’s what you’ll do. Your main goal is to ascertain the truth about Cymril, and in the process of doing that, you seek any means you can to thwart Neverember’s true plans for the city.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a rogue agent, you work without official Harper support, and are free to use your own methods and make your own decisions regarding whom to trust. Each new day is an exciting and dangerous game of masks—guessing who speaks the truth, who offers you lies in the hope of securing an advantage, and who is the true enemy in any given situation. You follow a morality of your own—one that seeks the good in any situation, without compromise and without being afraid to take the fight to those who oppose you.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Harper Agent Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain a Harper pin.<br/><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Harper Agent Utility 2</span>Harper's Healing Boon</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Your Harper pin gleams with silver radiance, shielding you from a vicious blow and bolstering your health.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b><br/><b>Immediate Interrupt</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="powerstat"><b>Trigger</b>: You are hit by an attack.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You take only half damage from the attack.
