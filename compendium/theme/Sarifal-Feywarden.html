		<h1 class="player">Sarifal Feywarden</h1><p><i>Baleful armies from the Feydark march, and the kingdom stands on the precipice of ruin. For the High Lady, I shall see these interlopers suffer the wrath of the feywardens!</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any fey race but drow<br/><br/>To become a feywarden, you must suppress the innate capriciousness of your kind. Threats to the kingdom are manifold, and the High Lady demands much of her champions. Only when it is time for Sarifal to retreat once more beyond the twilight veil can a feywarden relax his vigil. Heed the principles of your noble eladrin matriarch, and you might earn the High Lady’s appreciation.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are never completely at ease beyond the wilderness. Most feywardens run in a loosely organized party with the eldest serving as the leader. Rare individuals, such as yourself, are sent beyond the verdant confines of Sarifal to gather intelligence on the kingdom’s enemies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feywardens are guardians of Sarifal and all things that dwell there. Your principal enemies are denizens of the Feydark who seek to despoil the pristine lands under your protection. You distrust humankind, seeing their attempts to tame and clear the wilderness as wasteful. You have a deep reverence for the primal spirits that watch over the Moonshaes, the Earthmother in particular.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsiders regard feywardens as curiously introverted and evasive. Most feywardens are unaligned or good. Few fey realms are subject to the same sort of dagger-in-the-back power struggles that often erupt in human kingdoms, but agents of the Unseelie fey are ever watchful for opportunities to lure feywardens into temptation and ruin.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sarifal Feywarden Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: You gain the Sarifal’s blessing power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sarifal Feywarden Level 5 Feature (5th level)</b>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Nature checks. In addition, you have mastered the Spirit Fetch ritual. Once per day, you can use the ritual without expending components.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sarifal Feywarden Level 10 Feature (10th level)</b>: You gain a +1 power bonus to Fortitude.<br/><p><h1 class="encounterpower"><span class="level">Sarifal Feywarden Utility </span>Sarifal's Blessing</h1><p class="flavor"><i>You call for and receive a boon that shields you from harm and weakens your enemies.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Aura</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Choose cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or thunder.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisor lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You must have line of effect to the advisor to command it. When you command the advisor, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the advisor makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisor lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br/></p><p><h1 class="dailypower"><span class="level">Sarifal Feywarden Utility 6</span>Light of Sarifal</h1><p class="flavor"><i>Light emanates from you so intensely that your enemies cannot bear to ignore you.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Aura</b>, <b>Primal</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Personal</b> </p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: You activate an aura 3 that lasts until the end of your next turn.
