		<h1 class="player">Watershaper</h1><p><i>&quot;I am the still pool and the tempestuous sea.&quot;</i></p>The versatility of elemental water manifests in the talents of the watershapers. These elemental devotees can wield water as a weapon, sending waves crashing into their enemies. With experience, a watershaper can discover water’s subtler aspects. Such a master can use water to touch other minds, ease suffering, and alter one’s appearance to stave off age or conceal one’s physical connection to the Elemental Chaos.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the expressions of elemental power in the world, the art of watershaping was not an accidental discovery. Most who know of it see it as a blessing from the kindly primordial Ben-hadar to ease the suffering created by the Dawn War. Some skeptics suggest that the “gift” was nothing more than a way to help the primordials maintain a foothold in the natural world. Regardless of the motive behind its existence, watershaping has helped mortals travel around the world by enabling them to brave the ocean’s surface and explore its depths. All waterfaring people count themselves lucky if they have a watershaper in their midst.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watershapers operate as advisors, envoys, and arbitrators in the communities they live in or near. They keep the peace, urging calm in their fellows. As reasonable and diplomatic as watershapers can be, they have a stormy side. When one is roused to violence, he or she can be a dangerous adversary.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Watershaper Starting Feature (1st level)</b>: Your origin becomes elemental.
