You become an illusory duplicate of that creature, though you still carry your own gear. This illusion lasts until you end it as a free action or until your next extended rest. You gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks to convince others that you are the creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take damage from a melee or a ranged attack while you are adjacent to the creature, you take only half damage, and the creature takes the same amount of damage. You gain this benefit neither against the creatureâ€™s attacks nor against attacks that target both of you.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/379" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 379</a>, page(s) 30.</p>
