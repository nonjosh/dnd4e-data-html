The creature is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defender lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You must have line of effect to the defender to command it. When you command the defender, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the defender makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defender lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/405" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 405</a>.</p>
