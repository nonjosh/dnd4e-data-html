Choose one enemy adjacent to each weird to become the weird’s prey until the end of the encounter. Each weird must have a different creature as its prey. A weird has speed 8 and phasing, and is insubstantial to creatures other than its prey. Until all the weirds summoned by this power are reduced to 0 hit points, you do not lose the healing surge lost when a creature you summon drops to 0 hit points. When a weird’s prey drops to 0 hit points, the weird disappears. When you use a standard action or a minor action to issue a command to a weird, all summoned weirds can take that action. You can give a weird the following special commands.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Standard Action</b>: Melee 1; targets the weird’s prey; Intelligence vs. Will; 3d6 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and the target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls (save ends).</p><p class="flavor">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Opportunity Attack</b>: Melee 1; targets one creature; Intelligence vs. Will; 1d6 + Intelligence modifier psychic damage, and the weird pushes the target 1 square. If the target is the weird’s prey, it takes 2d6 extra damage and is not pushed.</p><b>Augment 1</b><br/><p class="powerstat"><b>Keyword</b>: Teleportation</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: As above, and you can teleport any two weirds, swapping their positions, as a minor action. In addition, you can teleport yourself and one weird as a move action, swapping positions.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/210940000" target="_new">Psionic Power</a>, page(s) 96.</p>
