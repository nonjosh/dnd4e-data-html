The creature is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisor lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You must have line of effect to the advisor to command it. When you command the advisor, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the advisor makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisor lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your healing surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/405" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 405</a>.</p>
