The ally whose power you gain must be present during the entire extended rest before you use this power. You can use your Charisma for the attack roll and damage roll instead of the ability scores normally associated with that power’s attack rolls and damage rolls. You do not need to meet the normal prerequisites to use the power, but you must meet any of its requirements.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951000" target="_new">Eberron Player's Guide</a>, page(s) 60.</p>
