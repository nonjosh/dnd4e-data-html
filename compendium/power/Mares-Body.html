While in this form, you retain your equipment and gain +4 power bonus to speed. When you move willingly, you can choose one adjacent ally, and for each square you move you can pull that ally 1 square. Your size category also increases by one (from Medium to Large, for instance); however, your weapons do not grow, and when you use a close power, you must choose a single square in your space as its origin square. You can end this form as a minor action.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 98.</p>
