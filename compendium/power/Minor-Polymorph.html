While in this form, you cannot attack, but you have the senses of your chosen form and gain its movement modes. If your chosen form has the aquatic keyword, you also gain it while in this form. You can return to your normal form as a minor action. If you are flying when you return to your normal form, you descend to the ground without taking falling damage. Observers can tell that youâ€™re a supernatural version of your animal form by making a successful Insight check against a DC equal to 15 + one-half your level.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: Your animal form persists until the end of your next turn.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/399" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 399</a>.</p>
