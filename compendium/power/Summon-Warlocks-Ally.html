The creature is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the creatureâ€™s description. You must have line of effect to the creature to command it. When you command the creature, you and the creature share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the creature makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 213.</p>
