Once per encounter, while this pact is active, the target can take a minor action to cause you to lose the use of one encounter power or daily power of your choice that has a level. When the target does so, he or she regains the use of one of his or her expended powers of the same usage, type, and level. For example, if you lost the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power, the target could regain the use of a 2nd-level encounter utility power. In addition, you can spend the target’s healing surges as if they were your own, if the target allows it. </p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 109.</p>
