Each round at the start of your turn, choose one of the four images. Your essence occupies that image, allowing you to act normally (including moving and making attacks).<br/>When you conjure each image, choose a keyword for it from among fire, force, lightning, and psychic. You can’t choose the same keyword twice. While you occupy an image, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls when you use a power that has a keyword that matches that image.<br/>Each image lasts until the end of the encounter, until it is destroyed, or until you dismiss it. Each image occupies 1 square, and creatures cannot move through an image’s space. An image can be targeted by attacks and uses your defenses. Each image (including the one you occupy) has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages an image. An image is destroyed if it is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. If you occupy an image when it is destroyed, you can immediately move to any other image still present. If you  occupy the last remaining image when it is destroyed, you reappear in that square.<br/>As a minor action, you can dismiss all remaining images and reappear in any square that was occupied by an image when you took this action.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 36.</p>
