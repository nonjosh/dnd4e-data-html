These results replace, in order, the next three d20 rolls the target makes for any of the following types of rolls: attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. At the DM’s discretion, trivial rolls and rolls that the target makes in nondangerous or nonstressful situations can’t be replaced by your recorded results. When all three results have been used or when you next take an extended rest, the effect ends. The target doesn’t know if his or her fortune is good or bad unless you tell the target.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: Once anyone has used this power on an ally, that ally cannot be targeted by the power again until after he or she finishes an extended rest.</p><br/>Update (6/28/2011)<br/>Changed to match July update.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/399" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 399</a>.</p>
