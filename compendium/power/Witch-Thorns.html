The zone can be up to 4 squares high and must be on a solid surface. The zone can provide partial cover and blocks line of sight. The zone is difficult terrain, and when any enemy attempts to leave a square in the zone, the creature must succeed on a saving throw or be immobilized until the start of its next turn. Once per round as a minor action, you can expand or contract the zone by 2 squares in any direction.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Special</b>: If the zone is created in an area of natural vegetation, the zone’s squares can be attacked, and it doesn’t vanish at the end of the encounter, instead remaining until destroyed. Each square of the zone has 25 hit points and vulnerable 10 fire and can be hit automatically by any attack, but it is immune to forced movement, all conditions, and attacks that target Will.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 96.</p>
