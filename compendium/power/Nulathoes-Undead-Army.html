You then summon up to five undead soldier minions in unoccupied squares in the burst. They are allies to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers lack actions of their own. Instead, you spend actions to command them mentally, choosing from the actions in their description. You must have line of effect to a particular soldier for it to respond to your commands. When you command a soldier, you and the soldier share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a soldier makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each soldier remains until you take an extended rest, until you dismiss it as a minor action, or until it drops to 0 hit points (which does not cause you to lose a healing surge).</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 111.</p>
