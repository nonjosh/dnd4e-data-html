The saving throw has a +5 bonus if the target is the same level as you or a higher level. It takes a -5 penalty if the target is a lower level than you or does not have a level.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the saving throw succeeds, this power has no effect. The target is aware that you used this power on it if it is the same level as you or a higher level. Otherwise, it does not know you used this power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a failed saving throw, the target treats you as a trusted friend for 1d4 hours. It truthfully answers all questions you ask and aids you in any way it can as long as doing so does not risk its life or property. While the target is under this effect, you gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks against it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect ends if you or any of your allies attacks the target or any of its allies. Afterward, the target doesn’t remember that you used this power on it.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247520000" target="_new">Heroes of the Fallen Lands</a>, page(s) 209.</p>
