The creature appears in an unoccupied space within range, and it is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the creatureâ€™s description. You must have line of effect to the creature to command it. When you command the creature, the two of you share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the creature makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you use a minor action to dismiss it or until you use this power again.</p><br/>Update (9/29/2011)<br/>Shadow Beast and Shadow Wraith changed in October 2011 update.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/280880000" target="_new">Heroes of Shadow</a>, page(s) 102.</p>
