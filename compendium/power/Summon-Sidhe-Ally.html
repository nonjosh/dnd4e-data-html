The guard is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the guardâ€™s description. You must have line of effect to the guard to command it. When you command the guard, you and the guard share knowledge but not senses. If you use a move action to move yourself, you can also command the guard to move up to its speed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guard makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard lasts until it drops below 1 hit point, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, the guard lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until you use this power again.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 109.</p>
