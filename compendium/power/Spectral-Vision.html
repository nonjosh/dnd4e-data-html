The objects are still visible, but you disguise their true nature, making them look, smell, sound, and sometimes even feel like something else. For example, you could make a pool of lava look like a plush carpet, or make a pile of coins look and feel like mud. If an object is removed from the area, this effect ends for that object.<br/>A creature can see through your deception by succeeding on an Insight check (DC 20 + one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier). A creature automatically sees through the illusion if it takes damage from a disguised object or disguised terrain (such as walking on an illusory carpet that is actually lava).</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 109.</p>
