The marilith has speed 8. You can give the marilith the following special command.</p><p class="powerstat">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Standard Action</b>: The marilith makes three of the following attacks: Melee 2; targets one creature; Intelligence vs. Reflex; 2d10 + Intelligence modifier damage (3d10 + Intelligence modifier damage against bloodied creatures), and the marilith shifts 2 squares.</p><p class="flavor"><b>Intrinsic Nature</b>: If you havenâ€™t given the marilith any commands by the end of your turn, it attacks the nearest enemy within its reach, or the nearest creature within its reach if no enemies are within its reach. If no enemies are within its reach, it moves its speed toward the nearest enemy. In addition, you take15 damage (20 if you are bloodied).</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Symbiosis</b>: While the summoned marilith is present, you can shift 1 square whenever you hit with a basic or at-will attack. Additionally, when an adjacent enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can make a basic or at-will attack that includes that enemy as a target as an opportunity action. This attack does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/385" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 385</a>, page(s) 57.</p>
