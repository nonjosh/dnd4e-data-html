It lasts until you fall unconscious, until you dismiss it as a minor action, or until you use this power again. Your dream form occupies its square, and you and your allies can move through it. When you take a move action, you can also move your dream form a number of squares equal to your speed. You can see and hear as if you were in your dream formâ€™s square, and you can use powers as if you were there. Your dream form can flank with your allies, and you gain combat advantage against any target your dream form is flanking. Your dream form can be attacked, although it lacks hit points. If it takes any damage, it disappears. It is immune to your attacks.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndlist&brand=All&year=All&type=CoreGameProducts" target="_new">Player's Handbook 3</a>, page(s) 95.</p>
