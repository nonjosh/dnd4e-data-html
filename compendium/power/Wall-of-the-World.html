The wall can be up to 6 squares high and must be on a solid surface. The wall is blocking terrain for your enemies, but your allies can move through (though not occupy) the squares of the wall. Each square of the wall can be attacked, has your defenses, has 50 hit points, and crumbles into difficult terrain if it is destroyed. As a minor action, you can repair 1 unoccupied square of wall within range that has been destroyed, causing it to be restored with 50 hit points. The whole wall crumbles into difficult terrain at the end of the encounter. </p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/317310000" target="_new">Heroes of the Feywild</a>, page(s) 83.</p>
