Its astral might burns away your enemies’ defenses.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Encounter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Divine</b>, <b>Zone</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Close</b> burst 5</p><p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: The burst creates a zone that lasts until the end of your next turn. While within the zone, enemies gain vulnerable 10 radiant and vulnerable 10 necrotic to your attacks. Depending on the deity you worship, the power creates an additional effect:<br/>Aurom: The zone is filled with a mind-numbing gloom. Enemies that begin their turn in the zone are dazed until the start of their next turn.<br/>Haramathur: Those within the zone take on the semblance of stone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 bonus to AC and Fortitude. Enemies treat the zone as difficult terrain, and enemies that begin their turn in the zone are slowed until the start of their next turn.<br/>Laeris: The zone is filled with a magical mist. Enemies treat the zone as heavily obscured to all senses, including blindsight and tremorsense.<br/>Nusemnee: Pulsing light illuminates the zone. While within the zone, allies gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws and can use second wind as a minor action (or as a free action if they can use second wind as a minor action normally).<br/>Sagawehn: The zone is filled with buzzing insects. While within the zone, enemies have a -2 penalty to attack rolls and to all defenses.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/390" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 390</a>.</p>
