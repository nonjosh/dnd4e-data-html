This towering servant wades into battle, smashing and destroying as you command it.</i></p><p class="powerstat"><b>Daily</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/bullet.gif" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Arcane</b>, <b>Elemental</b>, <b>Summoning</b><br/><b>Minor Action</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ranged</b> 5</p><p class="flavor"><b>Requirement</b>: Your familiar must be in passive mode.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Effect</b>: Your familiar is removed from play, and you summon an air, an earth, a fire, or a water monolith in an unoccupied space within range. The creature is an ally to you and your allies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monolith lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in the monolith’s description. You must have line of effect to the creature to command it. When you command the creature, you and the creature share knowledge but not senses.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the creature makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter. When the monolith vanishes, your familiar returns to play in passive mode.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/356170000" target="_new">Heroes of the Elemental Chaos</a>, page(s) 129.</p>
