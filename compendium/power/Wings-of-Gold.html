When you move, the zone moves with you, remaining centered on you. While within the zone, enemies that have vulnerability to radiant damage treat their vulnerability as vulnerability to all damage. In addition, whenever any ally starts his or her turn within the zone, he or she can make a saving throw to end an effect, including one that does not normally end on a save. Any bloodied or dying ally that starts his or her turn within the zone regains 10 hit points.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/253870000" target="_new">Dark Sun Campaign Setting</a>, page(s) 98.</p>
