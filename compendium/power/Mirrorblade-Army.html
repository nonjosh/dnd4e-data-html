Each mirror image occupies 1 square. Enemies cannot move through an image’s space, but allies can.<br/>You can make attacks, including opportunity attacks, as though you occupied the same space as a mirror image. A mirror image still provokes opportunity attacks as normal for using a ranged or an area attack.<br/>A mirror image can be targeted by attacks. It has the same defenses, resistances, and immunities as you. A mirror image has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages it. A mirror image reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Otherwise, the conjurations last until the end of your next turn.</p><p class="powerstat"><b>Sustain Minor</b>: The effect persists.</p><br/>Addition (10/13/2009)<br/>At the end of the third paragraph in the effect line, add “Otherwise, the conjurations last until the end of your next turn.”<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 63.</p>
