Each can make sounds and gestures but cannot voluntarily leave its space, and each of its defenses is 10. An illusory creature or object lasts until the end of the encounter, or until an attack hits it or a creature touches it.<br/>As a move action, you can cause as many of the illusory creatures or objects as you wish to move up to 6 squares each. Each acts as an independent entity, saying whatever you wish and reacting as you choose to other creatures. However, you must have line of effect to an illusory creature or object to control it in this way. If you do not have line of effect, it does not move or respond.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786949571" target="_new">Arcane Power</a>, page(s) 111.</p>
