You can take on the appearance of any creature of similar build and size, including a specific individual whom you’ve seen. You gain neither the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor the tactile or audible properties of your form or gear. For example, if you took on the illusion of a dwarf fighter in plate armor, anyone touching you would realize you weren’t wearing plate armor, and you would not clank, creak, or jingle as you walked. The illusion lasts for 1 hour, although you can end it as a minor action. You must keep the same appearance for the entire duration.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who attempts to see through your ruse makes an Insight check opposed by your Bluff check, and you gain a +5 power bonus to your check.</p><br/>Update (1/24/2012)<br/>Updated in Class Compendium.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217367200" target="_new">Player's Handbook</a>, page(s) 162, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd" target="_new">Class Compendium</a>.</p>
