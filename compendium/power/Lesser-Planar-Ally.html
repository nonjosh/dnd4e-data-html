The spirit is an invisible conjuration that lasts until it is dismissed as a free action or until it completes its task, which can take no longer than 1 hour. You command the spirit to attempt one of the following tasks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Locate an Object or a Person: The spirit can locate a specific object or creature within 5 miles of you that you have seen or touched. When it completes the task, the spirit returns to you and describes the direction, distance, and location of the object or creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Explore an Area: The spirit can provide a rough description of an area up to 20 squares on a side, including obvious physical features. The spirit cannot open doors or breach physical or magical barriers, so it cannot explore any area that a Tiny creature couldnâ€™t reach. It cannot notice anything that requires a Perception check to detect. When it completes the task, the spirit returns to you and telepathically provides a mental image of the area.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/247510000" target="_new">Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms</a>, page(s) 210.</p>
