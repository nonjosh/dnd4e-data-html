Others—separated from the city’s seedy side by wealth, privilege, or both—see the gang as a myth, sinister and perhaps a little glamorous. Little do these folk know that they might have rubbed elbows with the infamous leader of the gang, the changeling freebooter and assassin Kreelo.<br/><br/>Kreelo loves his life of crime, and he has honed his shapechanging skills to a higher level than typical changelings to support his passion. One might think wealth and freedom are the obvious allure, but Kreelo likes the deception and the rush more than the money. He enjoys feeling smarter and stronger than those he and his gang abuse and kill. He savors walking among those who would have him bound in chains or killed on the spot if they only knew the truth about who stood beside them.<br/><br/>Like their master, the gang members are bold in their criminal toil. No dishonest deed is beyond them, and they defy the authorities through bribery, threats, and an occasional murder. However, the Dark Daggers are careful in their targets and their travels. The upper crust has little to fear from the gang, and no member willingly reveals the gang base in the abandoned Silver Flame cathedral.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/173" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 173</a>, page(s) 88.</p>
