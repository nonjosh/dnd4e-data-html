A vocal advocate for exploration and research, he works to obtain items and knowledge for the foundation. He then catalogs and stores items, and he circulates what he learns.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Imre is also a double agent for the infamous Aurum as part of its Gold Concord. He works inside the foundation to exploit it for Aurum gain and to make sure he has influence, preferably ultimate influence, when Lord Boroman ir’Dayne dies. That’s an eventuality Imre is also working hard to ensure, and he has a number of other trustees on his side.<br/><br/>Imre embezzles, steals relics and replaces them with copies, and covertly obstructs the Aurum’s competition. He uses the auspices of his office to arrange expeditions that benefit the Aurum and to arrange foundation memberships for his agents. He also takes bribes to arrange memberships, but he’s very careful to work through intermediaries in that racket.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/173" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 173</a>, page(s) 92.</p>
