The marble elephant must end its move in unoccupied squares, and the rider still attacks at the end of the mount’s movement.</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Unaligned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> -<br/><b>Str</b> 25 (+12)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 13 (+6)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 16 (+8)<br/><b>Con</b> 21 (+10)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 2 (+1)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 9 (+4)</p><p class="flavor"><b>Description</b>: When you activate a figurine, the conjured creature appears in a space adjacent to you, provided the space is large enough to contain the creature without squeezing. The creature obeys only you, responding to commands spoken in any language. The creature remains for up to 8 hours or until you use a minor action to dismiss it. The conjured creature acts on the same initiative count as you. Every action it takes costs you a minor action (which you use to issue commands), and a conjured creature cannot exceed its normal allotment of actions (a standard, a move, and a minor action) during its turn. If you spend no minor actions on your turn to command the creature, it remains where it is without taking any actions on its turn.<br/>A conjured creature has hit points, defenses, and attacks as indicated in its statistics block. It has no healing surges and cannot be healed, though it can still benefit from temporary hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the conjured creature disappears and cannot be conjured again until after you’ve taken an extended rest. Conjured creatures lack basic attacks and therefore cannot make opportunity attacks.<br/>Mount: If the conjured creature has the mount keyword, you can ride the creature and are considered to have the Mounted Combat feat while mounted on it. While mounted, you can command the creature using free actions, though the mount is still limited to its normal allotment of actions. You can choose to be mounted on the creature when it appears.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217837200" target="_new">Adventurer's Vault</a>, page(s) 182.</p>
