This old man, variously called a sage or a hermit in folklore, travels from place to place with no apparent purpose. He’s quick to offer advice, information, or assistance to other travelers. <br/>One folk tale in particular is told with a hundred variations: The sage with the canaries shares a campfire with roadside travelers, offering mysterious advice that borders on prophecy. Still, the travelers would have regarded the old man as nothing more than a curiosity if it weren’t for the monsters that attacked the camp. Were they ever surprised when the old man started throwing around unfathomably powerful magic and turning his canaries into gold dragons.</p><br/><br/>Update (2/8/2010)<br/>In the Bahamut’s blessing power, add “until the end of the target’s next turn” to the end of the power. The effect lacks a duration.<br/><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242100000" target="_new">Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons</a>, page(s) 206, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/175" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 175</a>, page(s) 12.</p>
