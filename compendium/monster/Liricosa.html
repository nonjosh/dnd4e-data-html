Liricosa is the one living member of the race to have achieved true enlightenment. His wisdom and insight are rivaled only by his physical perfection.<br/><br/>Monks, philosophers, and those of all races who desire enlightenment (but particularly githzerai) seek Liricosa as a mentor. He does take disciples and shares his wisdom with the lucky few who reach him. However, locating him is no easy task. He seeks to experience many places throughout the planes in order to keep expanding his mind. He might be found on a secluded mountaintop in the world one year, and might establish residence in a crumbling keep in the Elemental Chaos the next.<br/><br/>Liricosa is in prime condition and has achieved such mastery over his body that he can withstand any environmental condition. However, he has acquired various eccentricities. He does not protect himself against the environment, which he no longer notices in his enlightenment. His speech is slow, contemplative, and slightly distracted. Every night, he tears a page from a different book, dampens it, and plasters it to his face before falling asleep.<br/><br/>Liricosa seems emotionless and evinces little concern for events around himself. Even news of calamities never shakes him; he simply nods and thanks his informant. He presumably enjoys passing on his wisdom to others, but his actions appear lifeless and automatic.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 148.</p>
