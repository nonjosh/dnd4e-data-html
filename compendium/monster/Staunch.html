Some simply seize what they want with brute force—or with the aid of a blazing crossbow. Staunch, a crippled warforged artificer and former artillerist of the Aundairian Army, is just such an individual. Embittered by his injuries and less than appreciative for what he considers “inadequate compensation,” he now hires himself out to anyone with a bone to pick with the Aundairian crown. Staunch usually serves as his employers’ armorer or sometimes as a head of operations for whatever thugs or grunts they retain. Recently, he’s been in contact with the Emerald Claw cell that hides within the ir’Uvanto family estate.<br/><br/>Staunch’s lower left leg was destroyed by some eldritch device of Cyran design during the Last War. No artificer, wizard, or magewright has ever been able to repair or replace it, so he’s built a harness around the stump with an enchanted wheel attached. This repurposing has given Staunch a slow, distinctive gait—and a surprising edge in combat. But for this unforgivable slight, he is delighted by the destruction of Cyre and openly mocks its survivors; he applauds Queen Aurala’s rejection of Cyran refugees. Staunch’s nihilist worldview has made him resistant to intimidation and unafraid of death.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/175" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 175</a>, page(s) 73.</p>
