A passerby might mistake this structure for a bastion of the djinns, but on close examination it seems to be constructed of ash-blackened steel. The clouds are in fact rolling banks of burning, suffocating smoke. This is the Choking Palace, home of Ehkahk, the Smoldering Duke, and his court.<br/>Ehkahk is a gaunt creature, the height of a human child, with ash-gray skin. Smoke leaks constantly from his eyes and mouth, leaving trails in the air when he moves, and pours from his back, giving the impression of flexing wings. Those who take Ehkahk’s small size to mean he is no threat, though, rarely survive to repeat their mistake.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 146.</p>
