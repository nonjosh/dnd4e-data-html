This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. At any point during the move, it makes an attack against a Large or smaller creature within reach: reach 2; +19 vs Reflex; the target is grabbed and pulled into the dust demon’s space. Until the grab ends, the target is dazed and takes ongoing 10 damage and ongoing 5 thunder damage. When the grab ends, the target shifts to a square of its choice adjacent to the dust demon.<br/>A dust demon can grab one Large creature, two Medium creatures, or four Small or smaller creatures, and it can move normally while it has creatures grabbed. </p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Dust Horde</b> (standard; encounter) </p><p class="flavorIndent">Five dust wisps appear, each in an unoccupied square within 2 squares of the dust demon. Each wisp takes a move action and a standard action right away and thereafter acts immediately after the dust demon’s initiative count. When a dust wisp is reduced to 0 hit points, the dust demon that created it takes 5 damage. Characters do not earn experience points for killing dust wisps created by this power.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Bloodied Winds</b> ( when first bloodied by an attack; encounter) </p><p class="flavorIndent">The dust demon slides the triggering attacker 4 squares.</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Chaotic Evil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> Abyssal, Primordial<br/><b>Str</b> 18 (+11)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 24 (+14)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 20 (+12)<br/><b>Con</b> 20 (+12)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 14 (+9)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 17 (+10)</p><p class="flavor"><b>Description</b>: The aftermath of the Abyss’s creation engulfed a tribe of djinns, scouring away portions of their flesh and souls until they were little more than sentient wind and bits of debris. The resulting blight-born demons, known as dust demons, appear as whirlwinds of dirt, dust, teeth, and broken bone that whip through one another so that it is impossible to tell where one ends and the next begins. Driven insane by their transformation, dust demons kill and maim out of endless rage directed against all creatures that do not suffer as they do.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 132.</p>
