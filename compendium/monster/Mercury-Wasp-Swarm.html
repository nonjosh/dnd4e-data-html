Called the Sea of Dust, few dare travel the trackless wastes because terrors beyond counting exist here, and the areaâ€™s landscape is as dangerous as the fiercest monster. For all the dangers it poses, adventurers still mount expeditions into the wastes in hopes of recovering the fabulous treasures believed to be housed in lost ruins and decimated cities. Few adventurers recover items, but the rare magic discovered is enough to draw new explorers from all over the world.<br/><br/>The mercury wasps were uncovered from the fabled Forgotten City. Mages deemed the items to be figurines of wondrous power since they shared the same properties as other items, but they had one distinctive quality. Rather than conjure a single creature, the figurine summoned a swarm of thumb-size black wasps that seethed and hummed with unexpected fury. Many believe these wasps speak to the character of the lost peoples destroyed long ago.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/384" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 384</a>, page(s) 22.</p>
