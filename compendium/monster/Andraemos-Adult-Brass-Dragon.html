These relationships, between a dragon and a fearful region, are the subjects of countless stories told in scores of inns. Many dragons are content to make a name for themselves in just a township or two. But others have larger plans.<br/>Andraemos’s ambitions began at a young age. Legend tells that he was one of four hatchlings in a brood, but he outlived each of his siblings, stealing their food behind the back of their mother. It wasn’t long before he had learned everything he thought he could from his parent and set off into his harsh desert home to make his own way.<br/>But Andraemos wasn’t done with his mother yet. She had seen the quiet ambition in his eyes and knew about the theft of food that enabled him to grow strong at the expense of his siblings. Such is the way of the desert, she knew, so she let it lie. But before Andraemos could escape her desert territory, she decided she did not relish the thought of a competitor dragon—especially one so hungry for power—lairing near her. She attacked, so the stories say, and caught the young dragon by surprise. But Andraemos was cleverer than even his mother had given him credit for being, and when their battle led into a narrow ravine filled with fragile, towering spires of rock, Andraemos finally found his advantage. He spun in mid-flight and fired a blast of fire at a precarious boulder perched atop a delicate spire of stone. The spire splintered and collapsed, and with perfect timing, the boulder fell on Andraemos’s mother, crushing her skull and driving her body to the ravine floor below.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242100000" target="_new">Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons</a>, page(s) 202.</p>
