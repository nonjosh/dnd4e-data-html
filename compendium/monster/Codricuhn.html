What the former primordial was has been replaced by chains and an unsightly blend of flesh and the remains of his elemental glory. Bits of a coral and bone skeleton are exposed or erupt awkwardly in painful, hornlike protrusions from his body. Where his body is whole, his flesh is a blend of angry red demon skin, masses of rock, and pools of bubbling magma.<br/>A single glance at this demon prince’s tortured form might suggest an unthinking beast or a tortured brute bent on attaining some impossible goal. Scrutiny reveals a dim sentience in the one baleful red eye, which is a gaping wound containing a jaundiced orb replete with crimson iris around an impenetrable pupil. As the eye rolls about, drifting in the socket, he aims his awful gaze, weeping bloody tears as if imploring witnesses to somehow stop him from attaining his unspeakable objective.<br/>Wrapped around his tumescent bulk are old chains, forged from iron, bronze, and adamantine, and terrible weights hang from their lengths—some wedges or blocks, some like anchors, and others wrought to resemble animals, monstrous heads, and more. Gods, mortals, devils, and demon princes added their chains, all in a futile hope of slowing the horror’s ascent as his fleshy appendages reach ever upward to find purchase in a fissure or ledge and pull his mass higher toward his goal: the Abyss’s edge. The chains that bind him have created a mass of sores that ooze dark demon blood, send forth streams of befouled water, or blast out a rancid, crimson vapor.<br/>Codricuhn’s form hemorrhages crimson mist from dark suppurating pits dimpling his body. Lightning dances in clouds swirling about him, crackling and thundering with the urgency of a summer storm. Codricuhn draws chunks of tortured earth to him, substance discarded at the world’s dawn by his primordial makers. These spheres of matter orbit the shuddering beast like the hands of a clock, counting the minutes and hours until the dire moment when the Blood Storm reaches its destination and heralds the world’s end.<br/>Each rock houses those fiends who swear service to the reluctant demon prince, and from these rocks they rule their tiny kingdoms, waging war against each other from time to time or drifting close to their horrific master to sample the ichors spilling from his flesh.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/172" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 172</a>, page(s) 91.</p>
