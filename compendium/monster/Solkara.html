She is the impossible weight of the bottomless depths, against which no living thing can stand. Solkara, the Crushing Wave, is a primordial lord who waits in cold rage for her vengeance. Like the sea against which mortal races build their fragile bulwarks, Solkara’s wrath can be forestalled only for a time.<br/>Solkara is frozen within a divinely built prison at the heart of a glacier as wide as a continent, deep within uncharted regions of the Elemental Chaos. Her dark form is scarcely visible in the ice’s frigid heart. For an age so long that mortals have no way of comprehending it, her worshipers have struggled to melt away the imprisoning ice. Now dark emissaries of her will, unseen for millennia, walk the Plane Below and the world once more. If they have risen, can their queen be far behind?<br/>Solkara’s monstrous form defies easy description. A scaled tail extends from a body supported by a pair of reptilian legs and made up of two humanoid torsos joined at the shoulders, sprouting three multijointed arms. Rising from these torsos, two sinuous necks connect to a single head resembling that of a ferocious predator of the deep. Water flows constantly over the whole without apparent source. Solkara is living proof that the primordials have no place in the world of the gods, for no sane creator could mold such a creature.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 152.</p>
