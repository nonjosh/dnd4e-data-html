First Failed Saving Throw: The target is restrained (save ends). Second Failed Saving Throw: The target is drawn entirely into the stone, leaving a faint imprint (no save). The target does not die but remains in stasis until it is freed from the stone. </p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Tentacle Grab</b></p><p class="flavorIndent">A writhing crag can attack and grab with up to three tentacles at a time. While grabbing an enemy, it can act normally, but it can’t use that tentacle for another attack. Enemies can attack the tentacle to make the writhing crag let go of a grabbed creature; the tentacle’s defenses are the same as the crag’s. An attack that hits a tentacle does not harm the writhing crag but causes it to let go and retract the tentacle.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Earth Glide</b></p><p class="flavorIndent">A writhing crag can burrow through solid stone as if it were loose earth.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Stony Body</b> (standard; encounter) </p><p class="flavorIndent">A writhing crag that does not move and retracts its tentacles resembles a jagged rock formation, stalagmite, or stalactite. In this form, the writhing crag can be recognized only with a successful DC 35 Perception check.</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Evil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> Abyssal, Primordial<br/><b>Skills</b> Athletics +25, Stealth +21 (only in caves and rocky environments)<br/><b>Str</b> 28 (+20)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 20 (+16)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 22 (+17)<br/><b>Con</b> 25 (+18)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 13 (+12)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 23 (+17)</p><p class="flavor"><b>Description</b>: Hideous amalgamations of jagged stone, writhing crags love the feel of flesh and bone being crushed beneath their flailing limbs. They have traits of both ropers and xorns and might be descended from either—or perhaps both, fused by the same corruptive taint that transformed them into demons.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 134.</p>
