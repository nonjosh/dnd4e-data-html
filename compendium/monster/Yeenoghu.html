Standing 12 feet tall, his body is gaunt and lanky, and patches of yellow fur stained with brown spots cover him. Leprous gray skin and suppurating wounds mar his body, revealing the corruption of his flesh and spirit. His head is a large, anthropomorphic hyena’s, with glowing red eyes and a toothy maw from which spill strings of drool.<br/>Always suspicious of treachery, Yeenoghu wears armor assembled from the pieces he scavenges on the battlefield, with bits of mail and plate held together by strips of flesh collected from his victims. His pride is Triple Flail, an evil weapon constructed from the bones of a god he slew during the ancient wars between the deities and the primordials. The handle is a thighbone wrapped in the god’s torn flesh. Three chains extend from the top of the handle, each ending in a rusty, barbed head. When used in combat, the weapon bleeds divine ichors, splashing the field with the tears and blood of the fallen deity.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242070000" target="_new">Dragon Magazine Annual</a>, page(s) 5, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/364" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 364</a>, page(s) 7.</p>
