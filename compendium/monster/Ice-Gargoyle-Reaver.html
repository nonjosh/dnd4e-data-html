If the attack hits, the target is grabbed. The ice gargoyle reaver can try to move the grabbed target as part of its next move action. If it succeeds, it can move or fly at full speed, pulling the target with it</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Ice Prison</b> (standard; at-will) </p><p class="flavorIndent">The ice gargoyle reaver encases itself and anyone it is grabbing in ice. In this form, the ice gargoyle reaver and any target it is grabbing gain resist 20 all, except against the cold damage dealt by this power. Both can still see their surroundings, but they cannot use other normal senses. A target the ice gargoyle reaver is grabbing is stunned, restrained, and takes ongoing 20 cold damage (save ends all, ending the grab and ice prison). Aftereffect: The target is slowed and weakened until the end of the ice gargoyle reaver’s next turn.<br/>Each time a target the ice gargoyle reaver is grabbing takes the ongoing cold damage, the ice gargoyle reaver regains 5 hit points. The ice gargoyle reaver can take no actions in the ice prison, other than to end the effect (a minor action). If the gargoyle takes damage in this form, the ice prison is broken, freeing the grabbed target as if it saved and ending the grab.</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Evil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> Primordial<br/><b>Skills</b> Stealth +19<br/><b>Str</b> 25 (+14)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 24 (+14)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 17 (+10)<br/><b>Con</b> 22 (+13)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 5 (+4)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 20 (+12)</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/165" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 165</a>, page(s) 38,47.</p>
