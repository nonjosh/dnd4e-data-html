Place a grabbed target in the maw. While the worm has a target grabbed, it cannot bite and no creature can enter the maw. The maw adjoins the throat. If a creature moves into the maw from the throat without being grabbed, it can shift to an unoccupied space adjacent to the worm. </p><p class="flavor alt"><img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/Z1a.gif" /> <b>Gulping Bite</b> (standard, recharges when the worm is bloodied) </p><p class="flavorIndent">Close blast 3; +28 vs Reflex; 2d10+9 damage, and the target is grabbed (escape ends). Place a grabbed target in the maw. Miss: Half damage, and the target is pushed 2 squares and knocked prone, but not grabbed. </p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Sections</b></p><p class="flavorIndent">The inside of each section of the worm—maw, throat, gullet, and stomach—is 2-by-2 squares and dark. A creature inside the worm but not swallowed has combat advantage against the worm. Moving from a section deeper in the worm to a section closer to the maw requires a move action and a DC 24 Strength check. Moving deeper into the worm requires only a move action.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Maw</b> (minor against a large or smaller grabbed target in the maw; at-will) </p><p class="flavorIndent">+28 vs. Reflex; 1d12 + 4 damage, and the target is swallowed. The target is forced into the throat.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Throat</b> (minor against a large or smaller target in the throat; at-will) </p><p class="flavorIndent">+28 vs. Reflex; 1d12 + 4 damage, and the target is swallowed. The target is forced into the gullet.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Gullet</b> (minor against a large or smaller target in the gullet; at-will) </p><p class="flavorIndent">+28 vs. Fortitude; 1d12 + 4 damage, and the target is swallowed. The target is forced into the stomach.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Stomach</b> (no action) <img src="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/symbol/x.gif" /> <b>Acid, Necrotic</b></p><p class="flavorIndent">At the start of its turn, a creature in the stomach takes 1d10 + 9 acid and necrotic damage, and the target is swallowed.</p><p class="flavor alt"> <b>Swallowed</b></p><p class="flavorIndent">A swallowed target is restrained (escape ends), and takes 1d12 + 4 damage at the start of each of its turns. The area of effect for its area and close attacks cannot extend beyond the section of the worm it currently occupies. If the target succeeds on an escape action, it ends the swallowed condition. If any target deals damage to the throat, gullet, or stomach, that target and all others in that same section of the worm gain a +2 bonus to escape rolls until the start of the worm’s next turn. Creatures outside the worm have no line of effect on creatures inside the worm. If the worm drops to 0 hit points, its flesh turns to dust in a matter of moments, freeing any creatures inside it.</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Unaligned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> -<br/><b>Skills</b> Stealth +22<br/><b>Str</b> 28 (+21)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 20 (+17)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 25 (+19)<br/><b>Con</b> 29 (+21)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 2 (+8)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 6 (+10)</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/9780786951024" target="_new">E1 Death's Reach</a>, page(s) 3.</p>
