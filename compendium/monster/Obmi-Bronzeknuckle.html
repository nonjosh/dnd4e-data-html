Though always smiling (even when twisting arms and breaking bones) and often charming, the dwarf ’s gray eyes are hard and cold, hinting at his true nature.<br/><br/>Obmi carries himself like a dwarven lord, and when he is in a foul mood he makes those around<br/>him address him as such, even his brothers. The title and whatever story of noble heritage he entertains in his sick mind is a delusion on Obmi’s part. Truth be told, the Bronzeknuckle family is as lowborn as a dwarven clan can be.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/173" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 173</a>, page(s) 96.</p>
