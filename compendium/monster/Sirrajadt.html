The burst creates a stormy zone that lasts until Sirrajadt uses a minor action to end the effect or is forced to return to humanoid form. Any enemy that starts its turn within the zone is slowed until the start of its next turn. Any ally that starts its turn within the zone gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and its attacks deal 5 extra lightning and thunder damage.<br/><br/>While in storm form, Sirrajadt cannot be attacked and can use only cyclone, storm strike, and storm surge. He can fly at half speed as a move action, squeeze as though he were a Tiny creature, and move through enemies’ spaces.<br/><br/>When Sirrajadt resumes his humanoid form, he appears in any space within the burst. He must resume his humanoid form after using storm strike or storm surge, or if the zone is destroyed</p><p class="flavor alt"><b>Alignment</b> Evil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Languages</b> Common, Primordial<br/><b>Skills</b> Insight +24, Stealth +28<br/><b>Str</b> 24 (+20)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dex</b> 31 (+23)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wis</b> 22 (+19)<br/><b>Con</b> 25 (+20)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Int</b> 28 (+22)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cha</b> 26 (+21)</p><p class="flavor"><b>Description</b>: The once-mighty djinns are few now, their great palaces and sweeping empire lost. Punished by the gods for their part in the Dawn War, many linger imprisoned in mundane objects. Those who remain free are mere shadows of what once they were, seeking to regain their lost power and free their kin so that they might rebuild the great djinn cities of the Elemental Chaos. Some, though, seek not recovery but revenge.<br/><br/>One of the last free members of a shattered noble house, Sirrajadt thirsts to destroy all those he blames for his people’s plight: the gods and the mortals who worship them, as well as those who failed to aid the djinns in their time of need. He frees other djinns only to increase the ranks of his followers. He does not believe that restoration of the djinn kingdoms is possible, and he scoffs at the misguided fools who seek it.<br/><br/>The Vengeful Storm is shrewd, cunning, and calculating. He is willing to cooperate with one enemy to bring down another, since he knows that he and his followers are not yet potent enough to complete their tasks on their own. He has cooperated with worshipers of the gods against the efreets; with one efreet house against another; and with either or both sides in various mortal conflicts. Sirrajadt’s patience is as vast as his rage.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/242110000" target="_new">The Plane Below</a>, page(s) 150.</p>
