For long generations, the Talons emerged but rarely, guided by their frost giant masters to raid and slaughter. But now, the tribe grants its fealty, its devotion, even its worship to a new lord, a draconic horror named Niflung dwelling deep in the nearby glacier, a creature whose only purpose is to see his “children” grow strong—at the expense of everyone else.<br/>Niflung, who has accepted the title of god given him by the Talons of Winter, looks much like other cobalt dragons. Observation of the dragon in motion, however, or a close study of his fearsome form, reveals peculiar anomalies. His limbs, his neck, his tail, and his wings seem unduly long in proportion to his body—not dramatically so, just enough to give him an unnatural gait and a subtly disturbing silhouette. His scales hang loosely on his body, occasionally jutting out at odd angles, as though he had spent ravenous years starving inside his own shell. And perhaps he once did, for his obsession with proving his own strength, and that of his “worshipers,” leads him to extremes that even other cobalt dragons would consider excessive.<br/>Niflung never holds entirely still; when he is conversing with others, at rest, or even asleep, his tail twitches, his claws flex, his jaw clenches. When he speaks with other creatures, his attention seems frequently to wander, yet he appears fully capable of following the flow and details of the conversation.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242100000" target="_new">Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons</a>, page(s) 212.</p>
