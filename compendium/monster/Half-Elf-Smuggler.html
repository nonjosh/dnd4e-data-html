River elves are fantastic guides and expert shippers, but both traits make them ideal smugglers. Illicit goods come into Fairhaven through the river ports, and the bulk of that trade flows through half-elven hands. Finding a smuggling ring and shutting it down can be part of just about any heroic adventure.<br/><br/>For most smugglers, the money and thrills are the goal. Such individuals like to think they’ve outwitted the authorities, and live for the challenge of escaping near capture again and again. But other river elves are hardened criminals without a qualm about bringing just about anything into Fairhaven if the price or incentive is right. Still others have political motivations. These reasons can come from dragonmarked houses such as House Lyrandar, governments such as Thrane’s, or even organizations such as the Ashbound or other Eldeen loyalists.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/173" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 173</a>, page(s) 93.</p>
