When dormant, the statuette tends to snag clothing and pierce skin with casual handling, and after a few scars and ruined cloaks, possessors learn to handle these items with care.<br/><br/>The alchemist Boreanis crafted nine bronze griffons for nine eladrin lords as gifts for the esteemed heroes of the war between Corellon and Lolth. When the lords passed from life to death and from history to legend, the figurines scattered across the planes to owners less worthy than those to first use them. Many eladrin nobles have more than a passing interest in these items and would pay a fine reward for their recovery.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drtoc/384" target="_new">Dragon Magazine 384</a>, page(s) 20.</p>
