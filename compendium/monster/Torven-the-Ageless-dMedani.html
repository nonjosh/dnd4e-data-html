On the surface, it is a group—with branches across Khorvaire—that reveres life and the dream of worldly immortality. It celebrates the eternal divine at the heart of all beings, and promotes self-reliance and self-exploration. Blood is seen as a symbol of life, the heart as the seat of the soul.<br/><br/>At its own heart—most of its members would be shocked to learn—the cult is a sect of the Blood of Vol. Some priests and initiates with dark leanings find their way into the cult’s inner circles. At the group’s center, within the Sovereign Ward’s dark deeps, an immortal oversees the Fairhaven group and influences its goals continent-wide. Undying in one of the only ways the cult offers immortality, this leader is a vampire.<br/><br/>Torven was once an influential member of House Medani. He faked his death to seize immortality. Now he maintains secret connections with his former kin, as well as a wider network across Khorvaire.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/173" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 173</a>, page(s) 89.</p>
