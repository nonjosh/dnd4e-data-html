Though the deity can appear in many forms, he is usually portrayed as a powerful dragon with platinum scales, the form he takes on when he goes to battle.<br/>Adventurers often worship Bahamut, who is called to protect the weak, fight evildoers, and defend outposts of justice and civilization across the world. Paladins in particular often bear his heraldry—a platinum dragon head in profile—on their shields or as a holy symbol. And although not all metallic dragons show obeisance to the Platinum Dragon, those working at cross-purposes are careful to avoid the attention of Bahamut or the legions of crusading dragons and worshipers at his command.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/242100000" target="_new">Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons</a>, page(s) 208.</p>
