Ralsor d’Lyrandar, airship pilot and dragonmarked heir, isn’t one of them. His relationship with his house is in a state of constant flux, marked by frequent embarrassments and ongoing, if empty, threats of excoriation. Yet his family is highly esteemed and well established, its coffers heavy with gold. Ralsor even owns the ship he pilots, assuming the role of both helmsman and captain though his crew is usually quite scarce. In truth, he is a masterful steersman who merely plays the part of an irresponsible and lousy pilot to avoid entanglement in the commercial obligations of the house. His membership in the Windwrights Guild was last revoked when he damaged yet another docking tower platform with the hull of his ship. Fairhaven’s Sky Knights, who ride the winds above the city on their dragonhawks, all know of Ralsor and despise him for his antics.<br/><br/>Ralsor considers himself an aerial vagabond, tethered to nothing but his ship—the Thunderhead, which has certainly seen better days—and the friends he takes. His closest approximation to home is Fairhaven, and he docks frequently at the Third Tower to visit with his longtime friend, Phorif Mirador of the Cellar Council. He avoids his kinsmen at the Chalice Center.</p><br/><p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/175" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 175</a>, page(s) 72.</p>
