The werewolf ’s bite exposes targets to this curse, rather than  werewolf moon frenzy.<br/><b>Check</b>: At the end of each extended rest, the target makes a Nature check if it is at stage 1, 2, or 3.<br/><i>11 or lower</i>: The stage of the disease increases by one.<br/><i>12-15</i>: No Change<br/><i>16 or higher</i>: The stage of the disease decreases by one.<br/><b>Special:</b> Lifting the Curse: Bestow the curse on one good creature of your level or higher. At the  DM’s discretion, a Remove Affliction ritual performed on the target also lifts the curse.<p class="publishedIn">Published in <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dutoc/214" target="_new">Dungeon Magazine 214</a>.</p>
